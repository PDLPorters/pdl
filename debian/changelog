  * In postinst, specify path to /usr/bin/perl so that users with a conflicting
    perl in /usr/local/bin do not get a blow-up.  (Closes: #141117)
  * (Note that the above change was made in debian/rules, NOT debian/postinst,
    because of the very strange way the original maintainer made the
    debian/postinst be auto-generated..)

pdl (1:2.3.2-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload
  * Newest version needed to fix gimp-perl build problems (perl
    segfaults on alpha otherwise).
  * Use F77CONF=debian/f77conf.pl, signify hppa needed changes in
    there instead of hacking Lib/Slatec/Makefile.PL .
  * Include small patch to change $(INST_LIBDIR)/PDL to
    $(INST_LIBDIR) in Basic/Gen/Makefile.PL (debian/rules has
    a very long, strange find command that barfs if there are
    multiple directories named PDL, and this looks like a typo
    anyway)
  * debian/rules was writing to file called "substvers", and
    was missing a $ anyway when writing Perl depends substvars.
    Commented out, added a call to dh_perl and tightened Build-Depends
    on debhelper to (>= 3.0.18).
  * Add call to dh_clean to clean up debhelper-generated files.

 -- Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Aug 2001 21:44:51 -0400

pdl (1:2.2.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

    breaks cross compilation since I've not released that package yet --

pdl (1:2.2.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * changed INSTALLDIRS=perl to INSTALLDIRS=vendor in debian/rules,
    for the new perl policy, changed Build-Depends to match.
    (fixes #95423)
  * made other changes to debian/rules and debian/control as indicated
    by this new policy.  I hope the OPTIMIZE attribute doesn't hose PDL...
  * FIXME: I've backed out compliance with 3.4.2 of the new perl policy:
    "Binary modules must specify a dependency on either perl or
     perl-base with a minimum version of the perl package used to
     build the module, and must additionally depend on the expansion of
     perlapi-$Config{version}." 
    This fails to indicate what context to use for that expansion. In
    my initial tests, this broke the package, and `apt-cache search
    perlapi` turns up nothing.

pdl (1:2.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * replaced mesag-dev with xlibmesa-dev in build depends.  (fixes #97508)
    replaced mesag3 with libgl1 in depends.
  * Rant: [None of this rant is immediately relevant to this version
    of PDL, except through examining the implications of bug #97508.]
    This whole "trash the old i/o-library interface" thing strikes
    me as *really bad*.  Interfaces should be treated as sacred,
    and maintaining backwards compatibility is important for long term
    system survivability.  Basically, what we're saying here is that
    these interfaces are immature, and people who built code against
    the earlier (obsolete) libraries acted prematurely.  Either that,
    or we're saying that distributing binary packages for debian is
    a mistake on the part of anyone outside of debian.  
  * I'm leaving the Build-Depends for libncurses-dev in the control file,
    even though it's now a virutal package, to see if I get any bug
    reports filed against pdl because of it (for the record, I'm using
    version 5.2.20010318-1 of libncurses5-dev to build this instance).

  * new upstream release
  * turned off make test because it has problems:
      1. requires an active X session (bad for autobuilders), and
      2. requires slatec (or linfit fails).  [Can't support
         slatec until ExtUtils::F77 is a debian package]
  * bumped up urgency because old pdl doesn't support newest
    perl, and some people consider that serious.

    files a postinst time which aren't removed even at purge time.

  * recreated source package, unpack in pdl-2.002 instead of PDL-2.002
    [this oddity in source package accounts for earlier diff problems].  
    (Fixes #45771).
  * do "make test" at build time
  * removed suggests jpeg-progs, I can't find any such package
  * removed suggests pgperl, there's a well labeled demo that fails
    and that should be enough of a suggestion for people who would want
    this non-free support.  If there's demand, and if special compilation
    support turns out to be needed, I supposed I'll have to create
    a pdl-nonfree...
