PDL Module Dependencies
=======================

This file lists dependencies of PDL modules on external
programs/libraries. Some of the modules will build ok
without the external software but in general are not very
useful without it. Others require certain libraries/include
files to be installed. See INSTALL on hints how to
enable/disable building of some modules in the distrib if
required.

The easiest way to resolve dependencies on other Perl
modules is to use the CPAN module to install PDL.
Installation should be as simple as

  cpan install PDL   # if the cpan script is in your path

or if you don't have the cpan script try

  perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> install PDL



MODULE          DEPENDS ON                  COMMENT

PDL (all)       perl >= 5.6.2           you need at least this version
                (5.8.x recommended)     of perl to succeed.

                File::Spec              version >= 0.6 required, included
                                        with recent perls (5.6.x and higher)

PDL::NiceSlice  Text::Balanced          a nicer way to index piddles
                Filter::Util::Call      a must-have!!

Inline::Pdlpp   Inline                  version >= 0.43 required
                                        module allows to define fast PP code
                                        inline in your scripts

PDL::IO::Dumper Data::Dumper            version >=2.121 is required to avoid
                                        a bug in earlier Data::Dumper releases
					which breaks PDL::IO::Dumper

PDL::IO::Storable Storable              version >=1.03 is now listed as a
                                        required dependency

perldl (shell)  Term::ReadLine          perl provides a stub but if you
                                        compile and install a better one
                                        (Term::ReadLine or Term::ReadLine::Gnu)
                                        you get proper command line editing



PDL::FFTW
                Needs the FFTW version 2 installed.  FFTW is a free C
		FFT library including multi-dimensional, real, and
		parallel transforms.  NOTE: the released version of
		FFTW is currently FFTW3.  You'll need to explicitly
		install the FFTW v2 library to build PDL::FFTW!
		See http://www.fftw.org/

                                        Will not be built unless
                                        FFTW version 2 is installed.

PDL::GIS::Proj
PDL::Transform::Proj
		A PDL interface to the PROJ4 geographic projection
		library and the PDL::Transform interface to the same.
		See http://www.remotesensing.org/proj

					Module will be built if the
					PROJ4 library is installed and
					detected.

PDL::Graphics::TriD
                Requires Perl OpenGL-0.61 module and FreeGLUT (Apple GLUT on Mac OS X)

                Also requires the OpenGL graphics libraries be installed, although
		the Perl OpenGL module should check for that.  For a free software
		implementation check out Mesa at http://www.mesa3d.org/

                                        Perl OpenGL is required.  To disable
					edit perldl.conf and unset WITH_3D
					and USE_POGL (see INSTALL).

PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT
                PGPLOT perl module and PGPLOT fortran library,
                see http://astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot for the library
                and CPAN at http://search.cpan.org/search%3fmodule=PGPLOT
                for the perl module

                                        Module builds ok without
                                        PGPLOT module and library

PDL::Graphics::PLplot
                The PLplot graphics library. See http://plplot.sourceforge.net 

                                        Module builds ok without
                                        PLplot module and library

PDL::Graphics::IIS
                To be useful an application that supports the
                'IIS' protocol must be installed, e.g. SAOimage
                or Ximtool, see
                http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/saoimage.html
                http://iraf.noao.edu/iraf/web/projects/x11iraf/x11iraf.html

                                        Builds without viewers.

PDL::Graphics::Karma
                Needs Karma visualisation library and tools.
                See http://www.atnf.csiro.au/karma . Binary distribs
                for many popular platforms available

                                        Module will only be built
                                        if library is installed on
                                        system.

PDL::GSL modules
                Needs the GSL (Gnu Scientific Library) to build.
                Version >= 1.0 is required
                See http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

                                        Will not be built unless
                                        GSL is installed.

PDL::IO::GD
		PDL interface to the GD image library.
		See http://www.libgd.org
					
					Will not be built unless libgd is
					already installed.

PDL::IO::Browser
                Requires a 'curses'-compatible library
                not built by default (edit perldl.conf to enable).  Build
                appears to be broken for many platforms.

PDL::IO::FITS   Needs Astro::FITS::Header for full support of all FITS
                header features.  Will build ok, and run, without it but
                for given that Astro::FITS::Header is a Perl only module,
                you should install it unless you specifically need not.
                It is currently listed as a prerequisite module for the
                purposes of building with the cpan shell.

PDL::IO::NDF
                Requires the perl/NDF interface (NDFPERL).
                (which also requires a fortran compiler and the
                fortran NDF library). Get the STARPERL package from
                http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/cgi-store/storeform2?STARPERL
                to get NDFPERL. See http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/cgi-store/storeform2?NDF
                to retrieve the NDF libraries.

                                        Module builds ok without
                                        NDF module and library

PDL::IO::Pic
                rpic/wpic: pbm+ or netpbm converters
                 http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/
                 and ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg for jpeg converter

                wmpeg: mpeg_encode program,
                  see http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/ftp/pub/multimedia/mpeg/encode/

                                        Module builds ok without
					converters but t/pic_16bit
					will fail without a recent
					version of netpbm.


PDL::Minuit     ExtUtils::F77           PDL interface to Minuit minimization
                                        routines in CERN library, see the link at
                                        http://wwwasdoc.web.cern.ch/wwwasdoc/minuit/minmain.html

	        The Minuit library code is included but requires a
		fortran compiler and the ExtUtils::F77 (version >= 1.03)
		to be built.

                                        Will not be built unless
                                        ExtUtils::F77 (version >= 1.03)
                                        is installed and Extutils::F77
                                        supports your platform.

PDL::Slatec     ExtUtils::F77           linear algebra routines
                                        several other modules use PDL::Slatec

                Slatec fortran lib is included but requires a
                fortran compiler and the perl module ExtUtils::F77
                (version >= 1.03) to be installed.

                                        Will not be built unless
                                        ExtUtils::F77 (version >= 1.03)
                                        is installed and Extutils::F77
                                        supports your platform.
