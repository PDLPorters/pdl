CED 22-May-2003
   - Better fallbacks for RGB images if PGPLOT-RGB support isn't installed
         (Window.pm)
   - pgplot.t test cleans up its own window.
CED 21-May-2003
   - Revamped tranforms demo
   - Added cartography demo
   - Fixed justification logic in Graphics::PGPLOT::Window::fits_foo
   - Fixed a bunch of documentation
   - Removed debugging prints from Cartography.pm
CED 20-May-2003
   - "arbitary" -> "arbitrary" in Window.pm
   - Fixed-up Transform demo
JC 19-May-2003
   - Updated Release Notes
CED 19-May-2003
   - Fixed FlexRaw to use binmode() on file handles.  Also fixed flexraw.t
 	to use binmode() in its byte-swapper.
CS 170503
   - Makefile.PL cleanup + restrict tests when vital modules missing
CS 140503
   - further Makefile.PL fiddling
CED 12-05-2003
   - Lib/Transform now doesn't complain with -w (addressing DJB's objection)
   - wfits now corrects the size of the output header.
   - Shrunk Cartography sample data
CS 080503
   - Makefile.PL now absolutely requires Filter::Util::Call & 
     Text::Balanced for PDL::NiceSlice
DJB 060503
   - Makefile.PL now enforces Perl >= v5.6.0 (+ removal of old code)
CS 060503
   - set OPTIMIZE via perldl.conf
   - PDL.pm: version @ 2.4.0
   - Inline::Pdlpp: new NOISY flag (show compilation output)
CS 030503
   - is_inplace: allow testing and unsetting inplace flag in one statement
   - complex.pd: fiddling with namespaces and other bits
   - add 'reshape' to lvalue funcs
CS 190403
   - export pdl_changed, pdl_children_changesoon and pdl_vaffinechanged
     into PDL::Core struct (for usage in external modules)
     bumped up pdl_core_version to 5
   - use those funcs to fix inplace ffts in PFL::FFTW (fix bug #716449)
   - pdlapi.c, pdlthread.c, pdl.h.PL: changes to help debugging the
     PDL Core; all pointers are now dumped in hex in the pdl_dump_XX
     routines
   - pdlapi.c: delete one statement in pdl_changed that broke, for
	example, calling fft with certain kind of slices (see comments)
        fixes bug #716447 (but note that I wasn't sure what this statement
        was required for in the first place; so breakages in other places
        as a result are not inconceivable)
   - disabled foomethod tests (foo.t) since foomethod broke as a result of
     removing the statement in pdlapi.c (see above). I assume that the
     statement in question was only introduced to make the foomethod work
CED 15-Apr-2003
   - Cleaned up a lot of documentation
CED 14-Apr-2003
   - By request, headers are now deep-copied recursively.
   - Removed a debugging printf in PP.pm
CED 12-Apr-2003
   - Various: Modified header copying to be quasi-deep, rather than 
	by reference only.  Changes to PP.pm, Core.pm.PL, and some
	test files.
CED 9-Apr-2003
   - slice.pd : Added permissive ranging to, er, range(). Missing source dims 
	are treated as if they dummy dims of order 1.  
DJB 09-Apr-2003
   - Fixed PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window::legend to correctly handle
     synonyms (confusion between PDL::Option's synonyms()/add_synonym())
CED 8-Apr-2003
   - Minor fix to Transform::map: if you supply a destination FITS header it
	replaces the original FITS header in the remapped output.
CS  Dev.pm: apply Michael Schwern's fix for ExtUtils::LibList
    Makefile.PL, Types.pm.PL: fix race where Types.pm.PL tries to use
        PDL::Config before it is written
    discovered bug in FFTW inplace code: breaks inplace routines with
    	slices; added TODO test to fftw.t
DJB 02-Apr-2003
   - moved code from Basic/Bad/bad.pd to Basic/Core/Types.pm.PL: should
     never really have been adding to the PDL::Type namespace from a
     different module! (no change to the user)
CED 30-Mar-2003
   - range now allows using the empty piddle as an index; the resulting
	range is the empty piddle.
DJB 28-Mar-2003
   - removed TYPES_LONGLONG hack from perldl.conf
CS
   - changed handling of bad values to accommodate longlong types
     general infrastructure overhaul to improve type handling
CED 27-Mar-2003
   - Added XRange,YRange keys to image handling in Graphics::PGPLOT::Window.
CED 25-Mar-2003
   - Fixed pgplot.t test to not use broken asynchronous I/O in perl5.
	Switches interactivity on an environment variable instead.
CS 25/03/03
   - karma.pd: added 'kvis' command to start new kvis app
CS 22/03/03
   - renamed det in slatec.pd to detsclatec; avoids name clash with
     PDL::MatrixOps::det; I tried to make the change backwards compatible
   - PDL::ImageND, PDL::FFT, PDL::FFTW: moved kernctr from PDL::FFT into
     PDL::ImageND so it can be used by both PDL::FFT and PDL::FFTW; both
     PDL::FFT and PDL::FFTW export it now by default
CED 20-March-2003
    - pdlhash.c: if PDL::BIGPDL is true, then ignore the 1-Gb limit on PDLs.
    - Window.pm: 
	- Fix labeling bug that affected some output devices (titles
	   were doubled in ppm device due to a pgplot buffering bug).
	- Fix handling of FITS headers in _fits_foo -- let PDL dimensions
	   override NAXIS<n>.
    - PP.pm:
	- hdrcpy bit is sticky, so that headers make their way down 
	   pipelines of operations.  
CED 18-March-2003
    - Core.pm.PL: fix '.=' closure (closes bug #630793)
    - pdlapi.c: Check that a dimension is nonzero before dividing by it,
	in pdl_make_physvaffine.  This bug might exist elsewhere too, 
	causing random crashes with Empty and Null piddles.  But at
	least this closes bug #671891.
    - perldl.PL: Put code to execute inside a trivial block (diverts
	runaway 'last' and 'next' commands, closes bug #573841)
    - ufunc.pd: Minmax now returns (0,0) when handed the null piddle,
	unless bad values are supported in which case it returns (bad,bad).
	(closes bug #659130)
    - Window.pm: fix bug #626344 (retain old cursor position)
CS 17/03/03
    - Core.pm.PL: fix topdl method (closes bug #681015)
    - gsl_integ.pd: fix for compliance with gcc
AJ  (17-March-2003)
    - Added PDL::GSL::INTEG
CED (15-March-2003)
    - perldl: Added multi-line string processing (using Text::Balanced) 
	and EOF protection to the shell.
CED (14-March-2003)
    - Obscure bugfixes and improvements to Lib::Transform
    - t/pgplot.t Avoid a perl bug (setting an alarm from inside
	the alarm handler sometimes fails!).
    - Primitive: uniq now always returns a PDL.
AJ  (12-March-2003)
    - Minor changes to PDL::GSL::INTERP
Doug Hunt (3-Mar-2003)
    - Added PLplot interface to PDL/Graphics area.  This
      had been a separate CPAN module (PDL-Graphics-PLplot)
CED (25-Feb-2003)
    - Added 'piddle' constructor synonym :-)
CED (24-Feb-2003)
    - slices.pd:
        - range(), indexND, & interpND now accept multiple boundary conditions
	- fixed up indexNDb and indexND documentation
	- portability fix to whichdatatype_double mod
CED (21-Feb-2003)
    - Modified whichdatatype and whichdatatype_double to represent nan with
	a double, rather than barfing.
    - Myriad small fixes to Transforms::Cartography
	- Perspective works properly
    - Changes to the documentation of Window.pm: axis() is better documented.
CED (5-Feb-2003)
    - Window.pm: 
	- ctab() selects window focus now (as it should).
	- lines() doesn't barf on trivial vector
	- pgwin() is much more forgiving in its syntax.  In particular,
	  you can say "pgwin(xs,J=>1)" and it'll know what you mean.
    - Basic:
	New ->fhdr method makes a tied FITS header if possible
CED (30-Jan-2003)
    - Modified interpND linear method (30% faster!).
    - Added PNG interpretation to ::IO::Pic.
    - Cleaned up RGB support in Transform/Cartography; fixed many bugs.
	in threaded transforming (mv(<n>,-1) is deprecated!)
    - Added FITS header support to transformations.
    - Added automagic RGB recognition to ->imag.
AJ  (29-Jan-2003)
    - Added PDL::GSL::INTERP and PDL::GSL::DIFF and corresponding 
	tests t/gsl_interp.t and t/gsl_diff.t
CED (28-Jan-2003)
    - Added fits_vect method to Window
    - Improved Transform demo (whizzy despiraling demo at end)
    - Fixed MANIFEST.
CED (27-Jan-2003)
    - Rearranged Lib/Transform to be more like the rest of the source tree.
    - Several bug fixes in Transform code
    - Improvements to ->map() method
    - Added truncation to ->range operator
    - Switched ->indexND to use ->range (for better data flow)
    - Added EQUIVCPTRUNC macro to PP, for permissive slicing operators 
	(like ->range) that can extend out-of-bounds.
CED (20-Jan-2003)
    - Added rgbi to Window.pm (requires newer pgplot & PGPLOT).
    - Added earth_image() to PDL::Transform::Cartography::Earth
	(this may not be the Right Way to do it)
CED (17-Jan-2003)
    - PDL::IO::Dumper uses more standard uuencode/uudecode than before,
	and uses external uuencode/uudecode by preference (faster than
	Convert::UU)
CED (16-Jan-2003)
    - Minor fixes to Transform.
    - PDL::IO::Pic is auto-used.
CED (15-Jan-2003)
    - fix to Dumper -- uses Convert::UU (instead of uudecode) if available.
    - Transform::Cartography::Earth -- update dumped info
CED (3-Jan-2003)
    - primitive: added glue() method -- arbitrary-dimension append
    - Transform: 
	- renamed Projection.pm to Cartography.pm
        - Added operator overloads to Transform.pm
	- Added "dual-method" functionality to map() and apply()
	- Reversed sense of map() and unmap() to make them more intuitive.
	- Added many map projections and helper routines to Cartography.pm
	- Added Transform::Cartography::Earth with local earth-map
	   (autoloaded by "earth_coast" helper in Transform::Cartography)
    - Window: 
	- Several minor fixes to lines
CS  - NiceSlice parser updates, see Changes in NiceSlice dir
    - .cvsignore files for the dist (autogenerated so hopefully
      no screwups, please let me know if you notice any problems)
CED (19-Dec-2002)
    - window.pm: Fixed off-by-one bug in ->lines
    - Transform.pm: Fixed some stuff in t_linear
    - Added Lib/Transform/Projection.pm
CED (17-Dec-2002)
    - Minor fixes to Transform.pm
    - Added "lines" to Window.pm
    - Added Earth map data file to the top level of the distro.
    - temporarily added "earth-interp.pl" to the top level of the distro.
    - Allowed "Methods" as well as "Functions" for func list in Doc.pm
CED (11-Dec-2002)
    - Minor fix to Windows.pm in _FITS_tr.
CED (10-Dec-2002)
    - Minor fixes to Windows.pm
    - First cut at pgplot.t -- test suite for pgplot windowing stuff.
    - Fixed up some Transform documentation.
CED (09-Dec-2002)
    Fixes to Windows.pm:
	- all Pix/Scale/Pitch parsing is now in initenv() (so, e.g., 
	  those options work on ->line and ->points).
	- initenv() knows about self->held for more convenient wrapping
	    (and fixing of the old doesn't-switch-windows-when-held bug)
	- _fits_foo implements generic fits_<foo> processing for easier
	  addition of fits stuff.
        - fits transformations are in _fits_tr
	- image range finding is in _fits_xyvals
	- justify works in a generalized way.  Justify=>1 works like you
	  expect, but Justify=><r> also sets the pixel aspect ratio, 
	  for more juicy flavor.
CED (06-Dec-2002)
    - Minor fix to range documentation
    - Shut up warnings in Window.pm sig handler and fix fits_imag (bug #649630)
    - Fixed bugs #633385, #634257
    - attempted to regularize justify option (in progress)
CED (05-Dec-2002)
    - Numerous fixes to PDL::Transform
    - Minor tweak to MatrixOps
    - Some cosmetic improvements to InterpND (better option control)
CED (03-Dec-2002)
    - Completely rewrote range code -- it's more elegant, faster, and
	more general now.
CED (02-Dec-2002)
    - added ndcoords (new index piddle constructor) to Basic.pm
    - indexND now uses range call instead of index call (works faster)
    - many mods to Transform
CED (21-Nov-2002)
    - PDL::Math loads PDL::MatrixOps by default for backwards compatibility.
CED (19-Nov-2002) 
    - PDL::Slices::identity -> s_identity; identity is now 
	exported from MatrixOps and constructs an identity matrix.
    - Ported MatrixOps to PP; moved to subdir of Basic; split the 
	matrix ops from math.pd and moved into matrixops.pd  MatrixOps
	is now autoloaded by "use PDL;".
    - Minor mods & cross-refs added to documentation in several modules
CED (18-Nov-2002)
    - Transform: improvements to t_lookup
CED (17-Nov-2002)
    - MatrixOps: improved inv and det can thread using lu_decomp2 
    - Transform: 
	- use svd to characterize the jacobian in integrative mapping
	- integrative ('jacobian') mapping works reasonably quickly and
	  is correct.  Some changes to options.
    - Better documentation for svd in math.pd
CS  - yet another special case for NiceSlice, see NiceSlice Changes
CED (15-Nov-2002)
    - photometric distortion appears to be correct -- but hogs memory like
	crazy.  One more iteration to make it usable!
CED (14-Nov-2002)
    - interpND defaults to 'sample' if its input is an integer type
    - Math::eigens is quiet about symmetrizing unless PDL::debug is set
    - photometric distortion (not correct yet but functional) in PDL::Transform
    - updates to MatrixOps.pm   
DJB (14-Nov-2002)
    - Added 'demo transform' to perldl to showcase PDL::Transform
CED (14-Nov-2002)
    - Math::eigens is now threadable.
DJB (12-Nov-2002)
    - Added the TYPES_LONGLONG option to perldl.conf: by default it is set to 1
      which means that PDL will try and compile support for a 64 bit type. Set
      to 0 if make fails (or fix the code to work with PDL_LongLong types!)
CS  - NiceSlice doc additions
    - PDL::Core: squeeze as reshape(-1) alias
CED (11-Nov-2002)
    - Transform.pm updates - conformal radial expansion, better 
	documentation, better composition, several minor bug fixes
CS  - NiceSlice.pm v0.99: fix modifier parsing + allow several modifiers
CED (7-Nov-2002)
    - Several updates to Transform.pm -- wrap() method, rot option to Linear,
	and improved composition -- but NOT (just yet) jacobian support.
    - Updated documentation for index() method in slices.pd
    - Minor tweaks to MatrixOps.
CED (6-Nov-2002)
    - Added MatrixOps.pm version 0.5
    - Added t/matrixopt.t
CED (30-10-2002)
    - Added Transform.pm version 0.5
CED (29-10-2002)
    - m51.fits: hand-edited the file to fix bad NAXIS tag (was 0)
CED (25-10-2002)
    - IO/Misc.pm: removed not-so-spurious warnings from rfits (bug #626342)
    - PGPLOT/Window.pm: fixed spinlocks for PGPLOT -- now faster,
	clearer, and actually functional (see bug #615277). 
    - Primitive/primitive.pd: fix to interpND behavior -- it now threads 
	correctly in the bilinear dual-threading case.
    - Lib/Slatec/slatec.pd: added nonsquare-array check to matinv.
	Similar checks are probably needed throughout to keep FORTRAN
	from dying.
CS  - PDL::IO::FlexRaw now understands all types
    - uncommented type longlong -- let's see how many installations
      break ;)
    - added t/iotypes.t
CS  ******** merged in type extension stuff
    - example of extending data types: add longlong type (64bit integer)
    - that type is disabled by default but you can uncomment the
      section in Types.pm.PL to try it out
    *** no modification of IO modules yet
    *** just the core changes to add the type + other changes to
    *** make all modules compile
    *** may serve as a testbed for type extensions
    *** needs testing with BADVALUE support
CS  - preparations for type extension: concentrate all type-dependent info
      in Types.pm.PL
CS  - cpoly.c: try to fix values.h problem on BSDs etc
CS  - patch for cygwin by Christopher Marshall (Bugs item #597985)
CS  - fix box2d threading bug
CS (25/9/2002)
    - 2.3.4 release branch merged into trunk
TJ (13-Sep-02)
    - Basic/Core/Core.xs hdr and gethdr XS functions did not strictly
      adhere to XS syntax. (5.005_03 xsubpp complains loudly)
DJB/CS (11-Sep-02)
    - 'make clean' now removes _Inline/ as does t/inlinepdlpp.pl when its
      run (to make sure that we're testing the latest&greatest code)
TJ (09-Sep-02)
    - Fix valgrind warning in pdlapi.c (use of uninitialised variable in dump)
    - PDL::IO::Storable now uses PTR2IV
TJ/CS (09-Sep-02)
    - Fix memory leak associated with magic
CED (30-Aug-02)
    - Fix to Window.pm documentation -- explains wart about panel()
CED (29-Aug-02)
    - minor fix to fits_imag -- axis labels
    - Added TightLabels (boolean) and TitleSize (float) standard options
	to control window labeling. 
CED (28-Aug-02)
    - minor fix to rangeb - physicalize index before checking its size
CED (27-Aug-02)
    - range() is now an lvalue, as are indexND and indexNDb.
    - pdl_malloc call is now via PDL Core structure, avoiding
	complete failure of the test suite :-)
    - extra debugging fprintf() calls deleted.
    - range() is a front-end to rangeb(), allowing omission of optional
	arguments.
    - rangeb handles boundary conditions.
CED (26-Aug-02)
    - slices.pd: added range (PP implementation)
    - Incremented core_version in pdlcore.h.PL
    - ->range doesn't spew debugging now (commented out)
CED (20-Aug-02)
    - slices.pd: added rangeND (first-cut implementation)
---- 2.3.4 release merged into trunk on 25/9/2002 (see above)
2.3.4
JC (23 Sep 02)
    - Changes to Release_Notes associated
      with making release 2.3.4
Frederic Magnard (2002-09-20)
    - Fix NAXIS in fits writer with Astro::FITS::Header
TJ (2002-09-20) - wfits should now write SIMPLE as logical with
      Astro::FITS::Header
TJ  - wfits now works correctly with Astro::FITS::Header
TJ  - Paper over weirdness in PDL::GSL build when Slatec is disabled. 
TJ  - func.t was failing if Slatec was not available. This was because
      PDL::Func was loaded before PDL::Slatec in t/func.t. Now fixed
      (and include an additional croak in PDL::Func).
TJ  - Compatibility fixes for perl 5.005_03
        + updated ppport.h from perl 5.8.0
        + lvalue problems with slices.pd and primitive.pd
        + Graphics/PGPLOT/Window/Window.xs now uses ppport.h
TJ  - Core.xs.PL used invalid XS for hdr and gethdr
DJB - Backported "_Inline removal to Makefile.PL & t/inlinepdlpp.t"
CS  - version to 2.3.4
CS  - backported a number of patches from the main branch
      DB 9/11:	Lite.pm typo
      TJ 9/02:	PDL::IO::Storable now uses PTR2IV
      		Fix valgrind warning in pdlapi.c
			(use of uninitialised variable in dump)
      		Fix memory leak associated with magic
----- branched off 2.3.4 release at this point
CED (19-Aug-02)
    - Window.pm spinlock includes special release_and_barf to unlock signals.
	(the Right Answer is to fix barf() to throw a __DIE__ signal;
	but that opens other cans of worms.)
    - documentation for some of the inplace-flag handlers
CED (16-Aug-02)
    - indexND: runs faster; doesn't check boundaries at all
    - indexNDb: includes "forbid" boundary condition (which barfs on violation)
    - interpND: skips trivial cases for bilinear interpolation (factor-of-2
	speedup for each dimension that is indexed by an integer)
    - Window.pm: 
	* ->imag labels axes, if you pass in label fields as options.
        * isolated initenv() viewport setup, so imag() can use it in pix code
	           
CED (15-Aug-02)
    - PGPLOT::Window fixes:
	- ticks default to outside for images; inside for everyone else
	- cleaned up pixel scaling code (used initenv() now) in imag
	- Image alignment code - you can choose how the image fits within
	  the box if you explicitly set the scaling (or use fits_imag)
	- fits_imag automagically draws wedges rather than modifying the title.
	- draw_wedge position defaults to 1.5 rather than 2 (avoids cropping of
	  wedge labels in the default case).
CED (12-Aug-02)
    - Minor speed increase to InterpND (still needs work!)
    - PGPLOT::Window::(imag1|imag|fits_imag) now does pixel scaling correctly
	(I hope) -- substituded pgqvp (viewport dims) for pgqvsz (window dims)
    - Axes now default to having tick marks outside the box instead of inside 
	the box.  That prevents scrozzling by images.
    - pgwin() convenience function is a little more convenient
    - Fix to spinlocks in Window.pm.
    - gethdr() can return undef again; new method hdr() is always defined.
CED (9-Aug-02)
    - Signal-deferral mechanism for PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window should
	avoid many pgplot-related weirdnesses
CED (8-Aug-02)
    - Minor fixes to fits_imag, also in PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window
    - Minor fix to IndexND, in slice.pd
    - now fits_imag doesn't attempt to reconcile different CTYPE units.
DJB (8-Aug-02)
    - changed behaviour of TextWidth option in PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window
      It is now only applied if specified (ie doesn't default to 1 and so
      clobber the LineWidth/HardLW settings). Added a little documentation
      but it needs to be improved.
CED (7-Aug-02)
    - Slightly cleaner MOD in ops.pd
    - added interpND (to primitive.pd) and indexNDb (to slices.pd).
CED (6-Aug-02)
    - New % operator follows (mathematically correct) perl % operator behavior
    - AutoLoad throws an error if foo.pdl doesn't declare foo().  (used
	to loop endlessly).  
    - AutoLoad error messages are more informative.
CS  - hopefully fixed bug with new pdl(arrayref) implementation
CED (2-Aug-02)
	- Add IndexND to slices.pd
	- Add pdl output for scalar context to WhereND in primitive.pd
CED (1-Aug-02)
    	- Incorporate FITS into rpic/wpic interface (allow conversion code
	  to recognize drop-in replacement functions for rpic/wpic)
	- Minor fix to FITS I/O version checking
CS  - add PDL::IO::Storable and PDL::GSL::SF hierarchy
    - fast pdl method! please test heavily
    - don't do opengl tests unless opengl is actually built!
    - mute annoying warnings from PP::PDLParObj
CS  - explicitly load PDL::Core in PP boot section
    - examples: make modules with Inline::Pdlpp! 
CED (26-Jun-02)
	PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window::line() autoranging avoids infinity
CED (25-Jun-02)
    Changes to PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window:
	- Added pgwin() -- exported constructor (less typing)
	- Added =>Size option to constructor    (less typing)
	- Added =>Units option to constructor (PGPLOT units only at the moment)
	- Interactive windows appear at the size you ask for. (less annoyance)
DJB - quoted "PDL::Type" in byte/short/.. fns in Core.pm to fix
      problem seen with using 'use strict' with perl 5.6.0
CS  - patch by Ken Williams to improve speed of 'pdl $perl_array_ref'
CS  - check for Astro::FITS::Version >= 1.12
CED (17-Jun-02)
    - add fits_imag to PGPLOT interface
CS  - allow niceslice to use the syntax
          $pdl($greater_1D_piddle)
        which indexes into flattened $pdl; result has same shape
        as $greater_1D_piddle
CS  - allow PP Code to handle constructs like
            $arr(n => 3*i+1)
        if Text::Balanced is installed
    - fix included Benchmark suite
    - NiceSlice.pm: make splitprotected interface similar to split's
CS  - fix PP.pm: bug #564937 (needed a check for sv_isobject(...) )
    - make sure pp_done is called automatically if user forgets!
CS  - applied Diab's patch #559860: improve trylink, Math/Makefile.PL
    - applied Diab's patch #559885: overload 'eq'
    - Inline::Pdlpp: fix join-bug, add MakePdlppInstallable to allow
      installation of modules with Inline Pdlpp calls, update test
      and INFO method
    - allow to set trylink 'Hide' behaviour from perldl.conf (suggested
      by Diab)
DJB (04 Jun 02)
    - minor fixes to the build highlighted by warnings from perl 5.8.0
TJ (31 May 02)
    - Use INT2PTR/PTR2IV to fix compiler warnings
      when the IV size does not match the pointer size
      (eg linux with -Dusermorebits). This will break compatibility
      with perl 5.005 unless we add some of our own macros
    - Fix prototype warning in rout.pd with PerlIO_print
    - Apply CS's patch to CallExt.pm to prevent spurious
      failure of DynaLoader in perl 5.8.0
2.3.3
JC (22 May 02)
    - Changes to Release_Notes, PDL.pm associated
      with making release 2.3.3
CS  - bump up NiceSlice version
    - gsl_random rng destructor!
    - improve PDL::Exporter doc (I never remember the darn syntax)
CS  - reshape behaviour like idl when no dim args are given
    - niceslicing gets a new modifier: $a(;-) drops dims of size 1
CED (16 May 02)
    - Several minor changes to Dumper and RandVar for compatibility with
	BSD and perl 5.005
CS  - Makefile.PL: warning if mods for NiceSlice missing
    - IO/Misc: print warning at the end of the make output
    - Graphics/PGPLOT: small change to the (still undocumented) autolog func
CED (15 May 02)
    - Added Astro::FITS::Header recognition to PDL::IO::Dumper.
CED (14 May 02)
    - Removed NiceSlicing from RandVar and Dumper (they use slice only now)
CED (from the distant past)
    - Added PDL::IO::Dumper, which provides deep data structure storage
	and retrieval in armored-ASCII format.  Requires Data::Dumper 
	(from CPAN), FITSIO (also from CPAN), and uuencode(1). 
CED (13 May 02)
    - Modified legacy rfits/wfits support to handle strings more cleanly
	(more like Astro::FITS::Header)
    - Moved missing-module message to IO/Misc/Makefile.PL
    - Added stringification test to t/misc.t
CED (10 May 02)
    - Modified rfits/wfits to support Astro::FITS::Header as an underlying
	FITS header driver. The fallback (to the more-or-less original KGB 
	code) is probably Wrong as string handling now changes depending
	on the presence of Astro::FITS::Header;
	whether Astro::FITS::Header is present; but ultimately everyone
	just uses Astro::FITS::Header and the problem goes away.
CS  - folded PDL-2_3-gimp-fix branch into main trunk
    - typos

    - Lvalue.pm : use attributes interface (fixes lvalues with bleadperl)
    - Core: remove pdlfamily.c dependencies and delete the file
            pdlapi.c: make_now noop, future_me etc stuff in pdl_destroy
    - PP: make_now is really a noop with above family changes - removed
    - doc updates
DJB (09 Apr 02)
    - added 'use PDL::Math' to PDL.pm (but not Lite/LiteF versions)
    (22 Apr 02)
    - added Kaj Wiik's patch to use pgtbox in PGPLOT/Window.pm (#538831)
      -- this needs documentation!
JB  (07 Apr 02)
    - Moved $CTAB to become part of the $self object in PGPLOT/Window.pm 
      This fixes the error that caused the second image plotted to hard-
      copy devices to become blank.
DJB (02 Apr 02)

      with making release 2.3.1
DJB - added WITH_IO_BROWSER to perldl.conf (default 0) to
      control whether PDL::IO::Browser is made. Will now compile
      on MacOS X 10.1.
CS  - get rid of Perl_die etc dependencies and other barfisms
    - make sure t/inlinepdlpp.t has a full search path to PDL::Core
    - Basic/Pod : podselect only when Pod::Select available
CS  - fix Makefile/Dev.pm bugs (that break build on PDL-free
      systems)
    - bump version to 2.3.1
2.3

    - PDL::Core::Dev helper functions for work with
      Inline
    - pictests only for internal PNM format
DJB (23/Oct/01)
    - changes to bad.pd in order to clean up build slightly (for 
      instance we longer need to create pdlapi.c from pdlapi.c.PL)
    - added Diab Jerius' patch [ #469110 ] for rvals/options
    - added a test for this [and fixed a bug I'd introduced]
DJB (15/Oct/01)
    - minor fix to ellipse (no longer requires options array) and to
      imag (will correctly handle transforms for axes with "-ve" pixel 
      size, such as RA in Astronomy)
CS  - Xrange, Yrange for PGPLOT, fix tline and tpoints
CS  - niceslice docs, class methods for PDL::Options,
      perldl: enable niceslicing at startup (if available)
      Lvalue: add sever method
CS  - Inline::Pdlpp docs addittions, test script added
CS  - NiceSlice modifiers + bug fix
CS  - Inline::Pdlpp !!!

JB  - Added a recording feature to the PGPLOT interface.
CS  - NiceSlice doc update
JB  (14/Aug/01)

      **** required renaming 'new' member of struct Core to 'pdlnew' !! **** 
CS  - Makefile.PL: Filter::Simple, Text::Balanced dependencies
    - bad.pd: fix for win32
    - Lib/Slatec/Makefile.PL: win32 fix
    - t/flexraw.t: remove extraneous 'use ExtUtils::F77'

    - win32: general update for latest build; add slatec support
DJB (20/Jun/01)
    - make bad.pd compile with PDL::Type changes and fix minor bug
CS  - fix rvals bug (annoying one!)
    - syntactical sugar: convenience operators for PDL::Type
CS  - Basic/SourceFilter (see also L<PDL::SFilter>)
    - generate PP templates with pptemplate
    - PP: pp_boundscheck (see PP.pm)
CS  - PP.pm: remove first '$this' arg from pp_add_exported!
    - LM.pm: fix implementation bug; still not sure if it works properly
             need more tests!
    - apply Raul's debian patch
DJB (7/Jun/01)

    - numeric for PDL::Char
DJB (24/May/01)

      axis). Added bad-value support to centroid2d and max2d_ind
DJB (8/May/01)
    - OpenBSD doesn't seem to have values.h, which causes Basic/Math to fail:
      see http://testers.cpan.org/search?request=dist&dist=PDL#2.2.1 
      Now using limits.h in Basic/Math/mconf.h for GNU systems - only tested
      on solaris and i386-linux.
    - fixed typo in debian/rules
John Cerney (5/3/01)
    - Simple change to primitive.pd so that interpol sub
      makes it into the PDL namespace, and not just the
      PDL::Primitive namespace. Also added a simple test
      case for this routine.
CS  - F77CONF variable for debian build (see INSTALL)
2.2.1
John Cerney (4/25/01)
    - Changes to Release_Notes, PDL.pm, TODO associated
      with making release 2.2.1
CS  - PDL::Lvalue -- PDL lvalue subs (added to loaders)
    - PDL::Matrix -- added docs
    - doc tidbits
    - don't test raster and SGI formats any more (pic(no)*rgb.t)
John Cerney (4/11/01)
    - Modified t/opengl.t to turn-off the PERL_DL_NONLAZY env variable
      when running this test. Due to some inconsistencies in the opengl
      headers (gl.h, glu.h) and what functions are actually in the opengl
      libs, PDL's OpenGL.so sometimes (When using Mesa 3.3 for instance)
      gets built with interfaces to functions that aren't there. Setting
      PDL_DL_NONLAZY=0 prevents the test case from failing in these
      cases.
DJB (10/Apr/01)
    - hacked Core/Dev.pm to work with perl 5.6.1 (ExtUtils::Liblist has
      changed although its documentation has not)
CS  - applied Christopher Marshall's minimum_n_ind patch (bug #413184) + test
CS  - fix mem leak patch so that core struct version croaking works
    * NOTE: recent patches will require recompilation of any external
    *       modules that use PDL::PP; PDL will tell you when using such
    *       modules *
    - barf is now really only an alias for croak; this is a test if we
      can live with the original croak; we should be able to!
    - update COPYING for the 21st century ;)
John Cerney (4/3/01)
    - Modified Makefile.PL in Graphics to add '-lm' to the libs.
      This fixes a 'Can't locate auto/PDL/Graphics/OpenGL/glpcOpenWin.al'
      error in make test during opengl.t for some platforms.
      Shouldn't hurt otherwise.
CS
    - make_physvaffine is now a member of the core struct
    - pdl_get is now vaffine aware (must be preceded by call to make_physvaffine)
    - worke around bug in the core logic (pdl_make_physical et al.) that
      cause index and others to leak memory; not the perfect solution yet
      but core logic is just way too confusing to make sense of it!!!!!!
      for details see comments in pdl_make_physical (pdlapi.c.PL) and
      pdl_initthreadstruct (pdlthread.c)
    - slatec: document the 'det' function
DJB (26/Mar/01)
    - PDL::Func now sets bc => 'simple' as the default for Hermite
      interpolation.
DJB (14/Mar/01)
    - PGPLOT::Window changes: addressed "undefined window size" part
      of bug #406858; added PosReference option + minor bug fix
      to transform()
    - renamed PosReference to RefPos. close() will print a message if
      a hardcopy device and $PDL::verbose is set, hack to fix bug 
      #408589 (draw_wedge() erasing plot) for simple cases (15/Mar/01)
DJB (27/Feb/01)
    - addressed PDL::Func bugs/doc issues as reported by 
      HalldÂŽÂÂŽÂÂŽór Olafsson and Vince McIntyre (bug #233484)
CS  - fix bug in pow in math.pd (reported on perldl mailing list)
CS  - fixed bug in writing pnms (bug #127696)
    - Core.pm: temporary fix to work around core bug (see comments
      in pdl_make_physical in pdlapi.c) that made convert
      leak memory (related to bug #116501)
CS  - fixed diagonal bug that caused apparently random errors
      (bug #116502)
CS
    - changes for win32 compatibility:
        pdlcore.c: avoid die_where & co, use Perl_croak instead
        Math/cpoly.c: win32 doesn't know about values.h
        Lib/Image2D/resample.h: win32 doesn't know about M_PI
        t/fastraw.t: skip mmap tests on win32
    - slices.pd: possible rotate segfault fixed
    - fix slight mslice problem (didn't make sure its inputs were
      converted to int)
    - new functions 'in' and 'uniq' in primitive.pd -> need tests
    - image2d: a slightly faster median: med2df
    - new function approx in Core.pm
        **** attention: possible name clash; test scripts should *****
        **** use tapprox from now on                             *****
2.2
John Cerney (20/12/00)
    - Minor changes to Makefile.PL and Reduce.pm for compatibility with
      perl 5.005
John Cerney (6/12/00)
    - Added new curve fitting routine: Linfit. Finds
      a linear-combination of specified functions
      that best fits data. (Similar to Polynomial.pm)
Marc Lehmann (5/!2/00)
    - Don't add artificial newlines in PdlParObj.pm, you never know what the
      surrounding code might look like. Makes PDL compile with perl-5.7 again.
John Cerney (5/12/00)
    - Updated log10 in ops.pd to have consistent
      copy behavior for subclassed objects as discussed
      in Objects.pod.
    - Expanded the tests in t/subclass4.t to test for log10
      and other simple functions.
      
CS  - added some features to dice
Doug Burke 
    - rcols(): do not read an extra line with LINES option (Frank Samuelson)
    - added draw_wedge() (& DrawWedge option to imag()) to PGPLOT 
CS  -  fix call of Perl_croak in pdlthread.c for threading perls (reported
       by Diab Jerius)
Doug Burke (03/11/00)
    - removed $_ from shorttype method: fixes $_->info() bug 
    - perldl/pdldoc now list other matches to a help query (not wonderful)
    - fixed 0.5 pixel shift in imag()
CS  -  fix bug in splitdim (didn't check nthdim) that can lead to coredumps
    -  Dev.pm: malloc debugging support
    -  Core.pm.PL: flat as clump(-1) alias
		   bug in mslice: cast indices to int added
Jarle Brinchmann (22/10/00)
    - Further bug fixes to PGPLOT added (courtesy of Kaj Wiik). Also a
      convenience function to calculate transforms (transform, courtesy
      of Kaj Wiik).
    - Examples/tests for the PGPLOT interface added in Example/PGPLOT
Jarle Brinchmann (21/10/00)
    - Considerable re-write of PGPLOT. This now uses PDL::Option to 
      set options. There is also now a OO interface 
      PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window which PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT now uses.
   
    - New functionality includes:

      - Interactive cursors (cursor)
      - Text on plots       (text)
      - Legends             (legend)
      - Circles, Rectangles, Ellipses
      - Multiple plot windows, oone can jump from panel to panel when
        the window is divided in several.
      - More control over options - see PDL::Graphics::PGPLOTOptions for
        details.
    This is not tested under Windows - and possibly not all functions work
    as they used to..
Doug Burke (18/10/00)
    - added warp2d (+ supporting fns) to PDL::Image2D. This allows
      images to be resampled using 2D polynomials as basis functions.
    - (19/10/00) bug fixes & clean up of documentation for above
    - rfits() now sets hdrcpy flag of piddle (so that the FITS header is 
      copied to new piddles).
Doug Burke
    - moved PDL::Type object from PDL::Core to PDL::Types. This shouldn't
      affect most people.
CS
    - split primitive.pd into primitive.pd and ufunc stuff (ufunc.pd)
    - changed loaders to reflect this split (PDL.pm, Lite.pm, LiteF.pm)
    - moved 'assgn' to PDL::Ops (since it's primarily used for
      overloading '.=')
    - added conv1d to primitive.pd -> this one was dropped
      from the dist at some stage but it makes sense to have it
    - Pic.pm: print conversion message only when debugging
    - fixed a problem with TriD: APIENTRY not defined when
            processing glu.h (since include files are ignored)
    - added sever docs
    - a reduce function for PDL (Reduce.pm)
    - percentile projections patch applied to primitive.pd
    - fix some thread_define problems
Doug Burke
    - improved support for bad values in r/wfits and r/wndf
    - added setbadtonan() to PDL::Bad.
    - moved log10() entirely over to Basic/Ops/ops.pd (so it's no longer
      defined in PDL::Core. 
CS
	- moved trylink to Dev.pm (L<PDL::Core::Dev>)
	- modified Graphics/Makefile.PL accordingly
Doug Burke
    - cleaned up endian support. Threw out my check_endian stuff since perl
      already knows - there's a isbigendian fn in Dev.pm (eg see 
      IO/Misc/misc.pd)
    - added setvaltobad() and setnantobad() to PDL::Bad, renamed replacebad()
      to setbadtoval() (perhaps should keep it as an alias?)
      setnantobad doesn't work (yet) if $PDL::Bad::UseNaN == 1
CS
	- added Matrix.pm (suggestion by Stephan Heuel)
	- Core.xs.PL: getdim, at and set now support the 'infinite dim'
	  piddle behaviour discussed on pdl-porters
	- perldl: $bflag incorrect due to low 'and' precendence
	- PDL.pm: the version was still far behind ;-(
	- Basic.pm: PDL->null breaks inheritance
	- Core.pm.PL: allow <2D piddles as arguments in creating functions
		(not yet reflected in the docs). Another step on the way
		to improve the balancing act between scalar and 1D piddles
		and normal perl scalars
	- Core.xs.PL, pdlcore.h.PL: PDL.malloc -> PDL.smalloc renamed
	- Core/Makefile.PL: endian stuff only when WITH_BADVAL (reduce
	  likelihood of build problems); don't assume that '.' is in the
	  PATH (good distributions like DEBIAN avoid that ;)
	- Doc/Perldl.pm: new (undocumented) aproposover function -- do
		your own thing with returned matches
	- karma.pd: PDL->malloc -> PDL->smalloc

Doug Burke (09/06/00-09/07/00)
    - Core and pdl_trans structure are now the same, whatever the choice of 
      WITH_BADVAL and BADVAL_USENAN. The version number of the core has been
      bumped to 2 (removing the need for Christian's recent patch) since this
      is binary incompatible with PDL 2.1.1
    - clean up of build process - both because of above change and also to
      stop problems when switching between WITH_BADVAL = 1 and 0.
    - exported several routines in PDL::Bad
Jim Edwards
    - improved OpenGL detection during 'perl Makefile.PL'
Doug Burke (09/05/00)
    - minor clean-up to the build process. Now creates Basic/Core/badsupport.p
      in top-level Makefile.PL for when PDL::Config hasn't been created - fixes
      setting BADVAL options in ~/perldl.conf

    - Bad value support integrated into the main branch. Set WITH_BADVAL to 1 in
      perldl.conf to use. See Basic/BadValues.pod for more information and try
      the two demos (demo bad, bad2).
      Many of the internals have been tweaked (eg many more files are created at
      compile time in Basic/Core - including Dev.pm; m51.fits is now installed 
      for the bad2 demo ...)
    - Basic/Core now contains isbigendian.p - this is created at compile time.
      IO::Misc::isbigendian uses this.
    - IO::NDF now saves byte piddles as "_UBYTE", rather than "_BYTE", NDFs
    - log10 is now in Ops (using C-library version), although a version is
      left in Core.pm.PL so that log10(2.3) returns a perl scalar, not a 0D piddle
    - removed 1-argument form of where() since been deprecated long enough
Jim Edwards
    - swcols added to IO::Misc - like wcols but to a string, not a file
Jim Edwards (08/25/00)
    - minor bugfix in TriD contour3d

    - minor bugfix to Graphics/Karma/Makefile.PL
    - made qsort and qsort_ind C routines in primitive.pd available to all
      modules via the PDL Core structure (pdlcore.h is now created by pdlcore.h.PL)
      and updated image2d.pd to use this (+ bug fix to patch2d)
    - added double precision versions of sum, sumover, cumusumover (same for prod)
      and average (eg dsum, daverage). Added prodover routine
      Changed stats to use this (+ changed PDL::Tests to avoid name clashes)
    - revamped Types.pm.PL
    - made Inplace option for pp_def a bit more sensible
    - marked several functions in math.pd as inplace (needs documenting)
    - fixed rndf() so that can use rndf('../bob')
Jim Edwards (08/08/00)
    - Major changes to the TriD code (requires perl 5.6.0)                      
Doug Burke (08/02/00)
    - 'bool' to 'boolvar' in cpoly.c to get it to compile under Linux

    - minor improvement to PP output if $::PP_VERBOSE is set
CS      - ops.pd: fix inplace problem (reported by Tim Conrow)
Doug Burke (07/27/00)

Tim Jenness (6/30/00)
    - PDL::CallExt now works on WinNT with VC++
Doug Burke (6/29/00)
    - added methods to PDL::Type - enum, symbol, ctype, ppsym, realctype
      and shortctype - which provide access to information in PDL::Types 
      eg print byte->ctype prints "PDL_Byte". 
      Changed info in Core and rcols in IO/Misc to use these methods.
      Currently un-documented.
Tim Jenness (6/28/00)
    - miscellaneous patches for Win32 support

Doug Burke (6/15/00)
    - hand-rolled podselect (podsel) created if perl version earlier than
      5.6.0
Doug Burke (6/9/00)
    - added Christian's changes to online documentation to support scripts
      (eg see Index.pod or Index.html)
Jim Edwards (5/19/2000) TriD (cvs brance trid_experimental) (merged 6/7/00)
        - several changes in TriD including a new Tk widget, 
          see the file PDL/Graphics/TriD/README  
        - added TkTriD demo to perldl.PL
2.1
Marc Lehmann (6/7/00)
    - enable sincos optimization only for glibc >= 2.1
CS  - warn if 5.004 that next version will require 5.005
    - PL_na issue in PGPLOT.xs
    - disable sincos optimization in complex.pd until glibc issues sorted
John Cerney (6/2/00)
    - Updated FAQ to match the Jarle's version at
      http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~jarle/PDLfaq/pdlfaq_new.html
Doug Burke (5/31/00)
    - more minor doc patches
John Cerney (5/26/00)
    - Applied patch to fix reflect options in conv2d (image2D
      function) not being symmetric. Ref sourceforge Patches 100287,
      100359, and Bug 104614.
Doug Burke (5/25/00)
    - added 'pdldoc' shell command to provide access to PDL documentation
      without having to start up perldl
    - cosmetic changes to output of usage + minor doc change to PDL::Basic
John Cerney (5/25/00)
    - Modified PP.pm to call $arg1->copy for subclassed
      objects in some simple cases, otherwise call
      $class->initialize. See Basic/Pod/Objects.pod
      for a detailed discussion.
Doug Burke (5/23/00,5/24/00)
    - corrected faulty t/interp.t and t/interp_slatec.t scripts
    - minor doc changes to Indexing.pod, image2d.pd, fft.pd & NDF.pm
    - added FRAME option to iis (Graphics::IIS)
CS      - hopefully the PDL::Filter modules will work now
                a proper test should be added
Doug Burke (5/22/00)
    - Graphics::IIS - now works with new PP code + minor doc changes
    - Func - changed gradient() to work as described + added PDL::Func::
      to method names in the documentation so they do not get picked up
      by perldl's help (eg 'help set')
    - \s to \\s in getfuncdocs() to avoid warning in Doc/Doc.pm
John Cerney (5/21/00)
    - Minor Changes to Basic/Gen/PP.pm to fix error reporting, and
      to get rid of some warning messages when run with the -w 
      switch
Doug Burke (5/19/00)
        - Amalgated Interpolate & Interpolate::Slatec into PDL::Func (found
          in Lib/). I've left the old files in the distribution, although they're
          no longer made/installed, in case anyone wants to do a better job.
        - minor doc changes to Image2D
zowie   - Changed PGPLOT::im to PGPLOT::imag1 (1:1 aspect ratio shortcut).
	  Avoids conflict with the imaginary-component sub by the same name.

CS	- fix for sever mem-leak -> ultimate source seems to be
		a problem in destroytransform on un-physvaffined
		piddle -- needs proper tracking down!!!!
	- more types for Otherpars (PP.pm)
Doug Burke
        - added PDL::Interpolate and PDL::Interpolate::Slatec which provide
          a (hopefully) simple, OO interface to interpolation methods
CS	- correct PDL::Ops docs
	- fix problem in pdl_croak_param (pdlthread.c) due to changes
		in Perl_mess in perl 5.6
	- update TODO
zowie   - Autoloader update (handles '+' for entire dir trees)
	- Graphics::PGPLOT::imag update (includes options for image scaling)
	- perldl update (minor fix to avoid null code ref bug in PDL::myeval)

CS	- debian stuff
	- image rotation (rot2d)
	- karma  kimagergb renamed to krgb
		krgb -> can send 3d RGB piddles now (i.e. [3,x,y,z] piddles)
CS	- quick (and semi-dirty) inplace fix for ops.pd
	- slices.pd: fix xchg,mv not catching negative dims,
			treat neg dim indices like neg perl array indices
Doug Burke (4/29/00)
        - fixed interpol failing to recognise extrapolation at 'high' x +
          added interpolate with slightly different error handling
        - commented out 'use PDL::Lib::LLSQRout' in PDL/Lib/Gaussian.pm
Tim Jenness (4/26/00)
        - Patch mconf.h so that it works on Alphas running Linux
Doug Burke
        - fixed apropos command to work with perl 5.6.0
        - t/poly.t failed on solaris 2.7 with new PP code. Changed check
          from < 200 to < 210.
        - added PDL:getdim to Core.pm documentation
Doug Hunt (4/26/2000)
        - Merged fast-xswrapper branch back to main PDL tree.
        - Left Ops thus:
          All ops are are overloaded to call XS as directly as possible, but
          the direct call of ops such as : $a->plus($b, 0) requires the '0' argument
          which tells the XS routine 'plus' not to swap the arguments.
CS
	- slight ops.pd changes
	- match prototypes with original ones in complex.pd
	- some more work on PP.pm (yet unfinished)
Doug Hunt (4/19/2000)
        - Cleaned up Ops to take advantage of new fast XS wrappers 

Doug Burke
        - changes to pod to HTML conversion. Links between modules - eg 
          L<PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT|PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT> - should now work.
          See Doc/mkhtmldoc.pl and Doc/scantree.pl
        - minor doc changes to a number of files
        - Improved output from apropos (aka ??) in the perldl shell:
          1) ref string is now cleaned of any pod directives (eg C<$a> -> '$a')
          2) the formatting has been improved, so that it fills the screen,
             word-wraps, and indents the ref string if printed on new lines
          3) better handling of long names 
          As an example, try 'perldl> ?? str' before and after.
          However, it's a *horrible* hack - using undocumented parts of
          Pod::Text to do 1 and 2, and calculation of screen width is poor.
          Needs testing on perl 5.6.0 for a start!
CS
	- applied vaffine leak fix to main branch
	- new polyfill function (image2d.pd)
	- some (unfinished) preparations for easier leak debugging, see perldl.conf
Doug Burke
        - Added PCHIP routines tp PDL::Slatec (interpolation,
          differentiation, and integration of functions).
          Also moved creation of SlatecProtos.h from Makefile.PL
          to slatec.pd
        - stop wfits() from complaining when reading in the header
          of FITS files from the DSS server at STScI
        - minor clean up of write_dummy_make() Basic/Core/Dev.pm
        - minor doc updates for PDL::Primitive and PDL::Basic
        - converted FFTW and GSL to use write_dummy_make() in Makefile.PL
Tim Jenness
	- Update PDL::IO::NDF to v1.02, enhance reading of axis errors
	  plus some bug fixes.
	- Add test for PDL::IO::NDF
        - Added polynomial fitting routines to PDL::Slatec (polfit, 
	  pvalue and pcoef)

John Cerney
	- Added (psuedo)-support for variable-size strings in PDL::Char

2.005
CS	- version to 2.005
	- finally try to fix 5.6.0 problem correctly
Doug Burke (4/4/00)
        - Changed to Basic/Makefile.PL to install man pages for PDL,
          PDL::Lite, PDL::LiteF, and PDL::Options.
        - Changed Makefile.PL to allow installation of documentation if
          INSTALLDIRS=perl (rather than site) is used
CS	- applied Karl's 5.6 patch to pdlcore.c
	- typo in Doug's error message fixed
Doug Hunt (3/23/00)
        - Improved error messages in PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT for the case when the
          correct version of PGPLOT (v2.16 or later) is not installed.


2.004
John Cerney (3/16/00)
	- Added -lm to the Lib/Image2D/Makefile.PL suggested by Doug Burke
	  to fix a compile problem on Solaris 2.7.
John Cerney (3/15/00)
	- Added Christian Pellegrin's bilinear and image scaling patch.
          with cleaned up docs and test cases.
	- Update Version to 2.004
Doug Hunt (3/8/00)
        - Added 'use PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT' to Demos/PGPLOT_demo.pm.  Now it works.
          This bug was introduced in my 3/2 and 3/3/00 changes.

John Cerney (3/5/00)
	- Modified Basic/Complex/Complex.pd to not generate warning messages
          when re-defining the PDL overloaded operator subs.
Doug Burke
        - IO::Misc - default type for DEFTYPE (rcols option) is now definable 
          using the $PDL::IO::Misc::deftype variable.

Doug Hunt (3/3/00)
        - Removed PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT from PDL.pm.  This had been causing
          troubles due to the previous change which took away autoloading
          in PGPLOT.  

Doug Hunt (3/2/00)
        - Updated Graphics/IO/PGPLOT, adding a typemap and a PGPLOT.xs file.
          This change added capability to PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::line, allowing
          one to use the 'MISSING' option.  When this option is specified, 'line'
          will draw many disconnected polylines (delimited by the value specified
          as 'MISSING') instead of just one.  This is useful in drawing maps with
          line.

Marc Lehmann
	- Patch to Basic/Core/Dev.pm fix Parallel build bug. (Ref PDL-Porters Messages
	  dated 1/8/00 and 1/5/00.)
        - Small Patch to Graphics/Karma/karma.pd. Change 'na' to 'PL_na';
          (PDL-P msg 1/15/00)

Robin Williams:
	- Patch to Graphics/TriD/OpenGL/generate.p to get 
          OpenGL working on OSF (it crunched because
          perlxs interprets the #ifs as comments 
          if they're indented).

Karl Glazebrook:
	- Patch to Perldl.PL to improve readlines handling:
	   - tells you which module it is using
           - correctly informs whether editing is available or not

John Cerney
	- Documentation fix for FlexRaw.pm (Based on change submitted
          by Francois Primeau.)
	- Updated Makefile in FFTW to correct a build problem that occurs
	  when both single and double FFTW libs are present. (suggested
	  by Diab Jurius).
	- Updated TriD Makefile to find openGL libs specified in the 
	  perldl.conf file.
	- Updated Graphics/TriD/OpenGL/generate.p to include patch by
	  Diab Jerius (ref PDL-Porters message dated 11/9/99). 
	  This fixes compilation problems with native openGL on solaris.
	  Note: Patch to Graphics/TriD/TriD/GL.pm was not applied. (Risk
	  of breaking GL on other platforms)

CS
	- added function 'det' to PDL::Slatec -> calculate determinant

Doug Burke
        - Graphics::LUT - added several intensity ramps, instead of just
          using a linear scale.
        - internal changes to Graphics::LUT - now stores data in external
          FITS files rather than within the module to improve speed and 
          reduce use of disk-space. 
        - first attempt at improving installation of OpenGL stuff
        - Graphics/IIS/iis.pd: minor change (re Christian's PP changes)
        - Graphics/PGPLOT/PGPLOT.pm: add CENTRE option [bin()], doc update
        - minor code cleanup for IO/NDF/NDF.pm and IO/Misc/misc.pd
        - added docs for sethdr to Basic/Core/Core.pm

Marc Lehmann
	- small changes to complex.pd: remove bogus Cneg, streamline docs.

Doug Burke
        - added TYPES/DEFTYPE options to PDL::IO::Misc::rcols()
          to specify the type of the piddles
          NOTE: (!!!)
            different from patch to 2.003 sent to perldl list 
            (http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perldl/2000-01/msg00037.html),
            as you now specify the types directly, rather than as strings.
        - added HEADER option to PDL::IO::Misc::wcols()
        - added BORDER option to PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT
        - added examples of new PGPLOT options to 'demo pgplot'
        - added t/lut.t to test PDL::Graphics::LUT, and
          added tests of options in rcols() to t/misc.t
        - minor doc update for PDL::Primitive - example for whichND()
          now works

CS
	- introduced switch for automatic hdr copying, off by default
	- PP: added pp_addbegin, pp_beginwrap and pp_setversion
		pp_addxs now adds to the current module's namespace by default,
		!not! to PDL anymore (patch by Marc Lehmann)
		pp_addisa now really works as advertised (i.e. adds to
		@ISA and doesn't split on whitespace anymore)
	- misc.pd: bswap functions work always inplace, remove
	  [o] from sigs
	- added PDL::Complex to the dist (first try of a derived class),
	  does remarkly many things already but needs some testing,
	  donated by Marc Lehmann

Doug Hunt
        - added PDL::Char, a subtype of PDL which allows manipulation
          of byte type PDLs as N dimensional arrays of fixed length
          strings

Doug Burke
        - added AXIS option to PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT + doc changes
        - added PDL::LUT module to provide colour tables - useful for
          PGPLOT's ctab() function (note: plan, in near future, to
          change to a binary format to reduce size of this module)

CS
	- Levenberg-Marquardt fitting module
	- added required additional slatec functions + some docs
	- some handy bits for PDL::Options function interface
	- bool.t didn't make it into 2.002 (touch problem?)
	- fftw.t test shouldn't rely on another module
	- PDL::Doc: support input from more than one file
	- Slatec/Makefile.PL: #include "g2c.h" seems unneccesary (and
		leeds to trouble on my debian 2.1 system)
	- PGPLOT patch from pdl-porters
	- Robin's Basic/Math patches

2.003
Christian Pellegrin
	- Patch to add an interface to the GSL
	  (GNU Scientific Library) package. 
	- Patch to compile under perl5.005_57
	- Patch to add an interface to the FFTW
	  library. (A free C FFT library including
          multi-dimensional, real, and parallel transforms)

Christian Soller
	- Patch to add 'any' and 'all' functions to use for comparison
          operations. (e.g. This enables things like any($pdl == 3.2)
           or all($pdl > 0) )
	- Patch to picnorgb test to fix greyscale and rgb 
          generation on some platforms.
	- Misc Patch: Make Image.pm return 1. 
          Make the gaussian fit routines use the correct
          xvals.
        
Karl Glazebrook:
	- Patch to Basic/Core/Basic.pm to fix bug in 
          centre=> when operating on pre-existing array.

John Cerney:
	- Put File::Spec in the PREREQ_PM list. (PDL now 
          requires File::Spec since PDL2.002)
	- Removed of ExtUtils::F77 from the distribution.
          Added ExtUtils::F77 to the PREREQ_PM list.
          (ExtUtils::F77 is already on CPAN separately.
           Having it also distributed with PDL causes
           confusion.)
        - Fixed cumuprodover docs to be similar to
          cumusumover.
	- Fixed typo in squaretotri function. (na
	  changed to mna)
	- Fixed IO/FlexRaw to find properly find the
          howbig function.
	- Fixed export of rasc and rcube in IO/misc/
          misc.pd.

Brian Craft:
	- Patch to FastFaw.pm to fix sysread problems when
          reading from fifos.

Lupe Christoph:
	- Patch to OpenGL.xs to compile with perlio/sfio.
             

Brain Warner:
	- Patch so t/poly.t doesn't fail if Slatec not 
          installed.


Robin Williams:
	- Added Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) function.
	- Patch to IO/Browser/hists/dec_osf.pl to fix
          small syntax in -D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
          define flag.
	- Patch to Basic/Core/pdlthread.c to clarify
          error messages when barfing.
	- Patch to fix problems with generate.p and
          OpenGL on Solaris. 


Helmut Jarausch:
	- Change to pldcore.c to fix problem compiling on
          a IRIX6.5.3 box using perl 5.005_57


Mark Lehmann:
	- Patch to pdlcore.h and PP.pm to overwrite
          croak() via PP and not in pdlcore.h

Joshua Pritikin:
	- Fix to Basic/Core/mkpldconv.p to change na
          variable to n_a.

Al Danial:
	- Patch to fix compilation on RS/6000
	  running AIX 4.3.2 and perl 5.004_04.

Doug Burke:
	- Patch to iis.pd to allow the user
          to change the title of an image
          displayed with iis().
	- Patch to IO/Misc/misc.pd:
	    1) Added option PERLCOLS so you can now read
               in columns into perl arrays at the same
               time as reading in data into piddles.

	    2) Changed the meaning of the 'c' parameter
               in the LINES option. It will only affect
               you if you use LINES together with 
               INCLUDE/EXCLUDE.

	    3) It now complains if you forget to surround
                patterns by //

	     4) It will also warn you (if $PDL::verbose is true)
                if no data is read in from a file.
	- Patch to PP.pod docs to clearup PRIV/CODE usage.


Tim Pickering
	- Patch to Basic/Math/Makefile.PL to get the bessy0
          and bessyn working again in glibc 2.1 systems. 
	  (glibc 2.0 as in RH 5.2 or
	  debian 2.1 is not affected)

2.002
John Cerney:
	- Modified Basic/Core/Makefile.Pl so that ppport.h
	  gets properly installed.

Doug Burke:
	- Modification to slices.pd docs clarifying the
	  usage of -1 to indicate the last element when
	  slicing.

	- Patch to Makefile.PL that allows PDL to be built and
	  installed conveniently away from it's final destination.
          This is useful for making RPMs.

Joshua Pritikin:

          by Starlink CCDPACK).
	- Patch to  Lib/Slatec/Makefile.PL
	  to fix problems compiling slatec with g77 on Redhat
	  linux

          in Indexing.pod.
        - Updated Christian Soeller's email address in all files.
        - Clarified docs on the RMS element returned by the stats
          function.
	- Changed how $PDL::VERSION is set so CPAN will pick it
          up correctly:
           * PDL::VERSION is now set directly in PDL.pm
	   * Makefile.PL reads $PDL::VERSION from PDL.pm and
	     auto-generates Basic/Version.pm 

Joshua Pritikin: Changes for compatibility with PDL-Objstore.
	Includes all the fairly conservative changes. More radical
	changes to come.
	- Deals with portability between perl versions using Devel-PPPort.
	- Adds a version number to the PDL API.

	   bug in ($i,$j,$k) = where($x,$y,$z, $x+5>0)
        - Added PDL::Fit-Gaussion Module
	- Patch to Core.pm so you can say $a = float(3,4,5)
          just as you can say $a = pdl(3,4,5).
	- Patch to slices.pd to export the dice and dice_axis
	  functions.

Robert Schwebel
	- Patch for the "perldl" shell that does the following:
	1.) Print out usage information if non-valid option is given. 
        2.) Introduce "quit" equivalent to "exit"
        3.) some linebreaks to fit comments into 80 char terminals

Christian Soeller:
	- Commented out the close(STDERR) lines in pnd.pd to fix a 
	  problem where the output from a 'die' is not seen for 
	  certain test cases after using rpic/wpic from PDL::IO::Pic.
	- Misc Patch:
		- negative positions for dummy
  		- matmult now also supports promotion to sig dims
  		- PDL::matmult naming corrected
  		- MathGraph: call PDL::random
  		- Pic.pm: use PDL::Options -> minimum matching now supported
   		         removed 'close STDERR' calls
  		- tifftopnm converter: added -nolut option
  		- pnm.pd:  get rid of 'uninitialized...' warning

           - updated pthread.t
        - Fixed a problem in pdlapi.c where some vaffine optimizations
          had been broken by in a previous version. (Karl also added
          a test case to complain if this is broken again.)

Doug Burke:
	- Patch to clean up some of the PGPLOT documentation.

Harry Felder:
	- Patch to Basic/Math/Makefile.PL to not depend on PWD 
  	  environment variable.

Doug Hunt:
	- Patch to Core.pm to add '$PDL::undefval' variable,
	  which controls how undefs are treaded when a PDL
	  is created from a perl structure using
	  pdl(), float(), double(), etc.

Tim Jenness:
	- Change to perldl to accept -w flag. This runs perldl
	  with the perl warnings (i.e. the perl -w flag) enabled.

Jarle Brinchmann:
	- Updated to PGPLOT.pm so that if you input a (100,1,100) image 
	  to imag, the 1-element dimensions will be ignored. It also
          checks that the piddle doesn't get too small, so that 
          if you input a (100, 1, 1, 1) image, it will be 
          treated as a (100,1) image by PGPLOT.

John Cerney:
	- Modified PP.pod to get rid of 'head3' errors from the pod2man 
          converters
	- Modified PDL.pm PDL::Lite.pm , PDL::LiteF.pm so that the $VERSION would
   	  be picked up correctly. 'use PDL 2.0' now correctly checks the version.

	- PP.pm and PP.pod additions for subclassing.
	- Minor Change to Html.pm to correct problem with it 
	  creating false html references from .pod text that contained
	  '=head' as examples.
	- Updates to Doc/mkhtmldoc.pl to fix most problems with html documents
	  not referencing each other correctly. In order to not change multiple
          .pod documents and documentation in .pm files, html docs will now be
          installed in ..../site_perl/PDL/htmldocs/PDL instead of 
	  ..../site_perl/PDL/htmldocs. (If installing over a previous version,
	  the html files in .../site_perl/PDL/htmldocs should be deleted to
 	  avoid confusion.

Robin Williams:
	- FFT test file addition (t/fft.t)
	  (Test number 2 fails... commented-out for now)

Andy Dougherty, John Cerney
	- Changes to compile with perl5.005

Anton Berezin:

Robin Williams:
	- Change behavior of overloaded bool operator
	  to not stringify. This was causing a major
 	  slowdown in cases where a PDL object was
	  being tested in a boolean context. (e.g.
	  if($PDL){ ...} )

1.9902
Tjl:
 - fix pdlcore.c to work with MAGIC hashes, to enable really
   wild constructions to come
 - twiddle with flexraw.t
 - PP cleanup: let 'SIZE' be used in RedoDimsCode. (needs to be cleaned
   up from the other kind of access to this.. also need '$PDL(a)')
 - null = just flag, so 0-dimensions are now allowed.
 - allow which to take other types for mask as well... - required
   cleaning PP to make RedoDimsCode be parsed just like Code, except
   without threadloop. Seems to work nicely.
   (I needed to take ($a == byte 5)->which for a large byte $a and
   was horrified to find that my program grew to dozens of Mb)
   !!! Note: possible incompatibility: before a floating value 0<v<1
   would be interpreted as false, now true - but more logical this
   way.
 - where to take multiple arguments before the mask,
   to map them all through the mask.
 - add 'isnull' to Core.xs
 - Basic/Gen/PP/PDLCode.pm to 'use strict', just in case...
 - add 'Config.pm' to help with tests
    - flexraw.t to use this
    - Makefile.PLs to set the results of the tests.
    - Maybe add PDL::Config_user later to store original
      config hash values from user.
 - threadover to clear NOMYDIMS flag.
Raphael:
 - Callext fixes for hp-ux, required an interface change !!!
TODO:

   places just use that, especially the tests..

1.9901

    'output ' with 'print' in the printouts; beginners might be confused
    by the 'output' abstraction)
  - new demo '3dgal' for the TriD Gallery
  - install PDL::Graphics::VRML::Protos in the correct place
  - fixed picrgb test to generate a warning when broken

 - default.perldlrc: set verbose=0 to stop too much waffling!
Karl [via Gerald]

   All unused slatec functions were got rid of which fortunately
   removed all the ones with COMPLEX arguments. Also changed

 - Robin's problems 'compiling pdl 1.54_06 Basic/Math' patch 17/12/97

   Rejected because of following error (Linux/gcc)

     const.c:80: parse error before `3.14159265358979323846'
     const.c:99: parse error before `__extension__'
     const.c:99: parse error before `}'

   Can the patch be revised?

 - Robin's at() accepts -ve indices patch. Can we have set() to?
 - removed 'docscan' and 'pdlhead2item' from MANIFEST - OK ?

1.95_06

  KGB

  - FITS patch
  - restored cc8compt fibonacci from pdl-porters archive (!)
  - fixed misc module name problems in tests (thanks Bob!)
  - Robin and Christian's help patches
  - Robin's Object.pod patch
  - Achim: chmod 0755 on Doc/*.PL,
  - Achim wanted pdldoc.db in archlib, ignored this (don't understand
    why)
  - put fudge in ops.pd to get rid of that stupid compiler warning
    with abs() and byte/ushort types
  - rebuilt MANIFEST hope it is OK now

  - introduced new barf(...) routine in Core.pm and pdlcore.c
    [see help barf]

    we should use barf(...) in C and Perl code instead of croak etc.

    Note the barf engine is written in Perl, so is easy to customize!

  - changed references to 'croak' in pd/xs/c code to barf(..)
    or Perl_croak where appropriate
  - changed references to 'croak' in various .pm files to barf()
    where appropriate
  - croak #defined to barf() in pdlcore.h to catch the use in
    xsubpp (..fingers crossed..). Perhaps future xsubpp will allow
    an override of this.

  - renamed PDL::Io:: heirarchy PDL::IO:: for consistency with Perl IO::

1.95_05

  KGB

  - Renamed PDL.pdl_make_physical PDL.make_physical (woops!) - ditto
    physdims().

  - Changed type config. Now Types.pm pdl.h pdlsimple.h are generated
    AUTOMATICALLY from Types.pm.PL pdl.h.PL and pdlsimple.h.PL
    files using perl Config information. int size issue is now handled
    from perl config information. Lots of potential for more flexibility.
    Hope this doesn't break Alpha stuff by mistake!

  - Revised PDL::CallExt. Now uses make_physical rather than PP and allows
    unlimited args in the same way as PDL-1.11. Ought to be more compiler
    friendly too! Put callext.t back.

  - Added 'dog' and 'cat'

1.95_04

  KGB

  - Added glEnable/DisableClientState to dontfunc in OpenGL
  - Doug: added fake MAIN_ to cfft.f in Slatec for old g77s
  - Achim's patches of 4/12
  - my IIS changes
  - Robin's random and Inf/NaN patches of 4/12
  - Christian:  'minor doc polishing Core.pm+primitive.pd'
  - Christian: INSTALL patches.
  - Christian: 'docs in Doc/Doc/Perldl.pm'
  - Robin's minor perldl docs patch
  - Restored my missing hist() patch and test of Oct 10th (sic)
  - Achim's suggestions on help 'help' and help 'perldl', '?' and
    allow no quotes (with warning)
  - Added solaris_2 hints file for OpenGL
  - Robins perldl pod patches but NOT 'l' as a synonym for 'last'
    (I don't like this as 'last' is a perl keyword)

1.95_03

  KGB:

  - Various small changes to TriD/test*.pl scripts. Renamed as *.p
  - minor TriD changes to comply with new zeroes() etc.
  - moved tests all into one top level t/ directory.
  - corrected PDL::initialise and convert (Christian)
  - Robin's primitive.pd patch
  - callext.t temporarily disabled - I will rewrite the module.
  - Minor changes to 'Doc'.
  - TriD renamed to PDL::Graphics::TriD

1.95_02 [emergency bug fixing release]

 KGB:

 - Redid all the zeroes/ones/[xyrz]vals/[g]random/sequence stuff
   someone please please give me some objective advice :-)
 - Added Robin's new FFT
 - 3 byte change to Pnm.pm for new zeroes()
 - added make_physical and make_physdims to PDL struct

1.95_01

KGB:

 - Added Cephes code to PDL::Math as backup, changed signature of
   jn, yn.
 - changed scalar convesion in pdlcore.c SvPDLV() - '2.0' is now
   double, '2' is now int. [Uses SvNOK SvIOK etc] - changed
   Basic/t/conv.t to comply.
 - Added magic {PDL} = code ref hook. And put test/example in
   subclass.t
 - random() is now like zeroes() and both allow type/dim and
   $x template arguments. New arg proc. method to support this.
 - Added grandom().
 - Ressurected PDL::Exporter (q.v.). Much simpler than bizarrity
   in PDL-1.11. Now 'use PDL::Mod' defaults to loading ':Func'.
   Provision for noimports. Less typing!!!! Modified docs too.
 - Renamed PDL::Graphics::PG PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT
 - Reverted to manpages named PDL::FAQ.1, PDL::Dataflow.1, etc.
   This is simpler and maintains consistence between manpage
   and pod browsers. Fixed all the text links to comply.
 - small changes to Pod/ docs.
 - shut PP the hell up! Much less scary build now.
 - added Pods to files scanned in building doc database.
 - [xvyz]rvals now act like zeroes - but they now act like
    constructos so $derived->xvals does not give you what
    you expect. Need to think about this some more.

1.94_09

KGB: NOTE ONE MAJOR INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE [random]

 - removed PDL_OPTIONS - PDL_CONFIG for everything. I think this is
   better, e.g. if we want debugging we can add Debugging=>1 to
   %PDL_CONFIG.
 - changed use of PDL_CONFIG - see INSTALL. I think this is simpler.
 - made Karma conform with above - and simplified.
 - changed Callext arg limit to 10 to avoid compiler explosions.
 - integrated PDL::Doc, created PDL::Doc::Perldl.
 - manifying is now back from the .pm file rather then the .pd
   (this is a better design now pod are semi-generated from PP)
 - Christian's patches of 25/11/97:
   'Core.xs and pdlapi.c'
   'test' for Io::Pic
 - added docs for Doc field in PP.pod and made one-line a special case
 - Moved statistical functions from Basic.pm to Primitive.pm
 - Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and
   lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and
   lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and
   lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and
   lots and lotsof miscellaneous docs.
 - Robin's browser patch of 26/11
 - Core now completely OO - i.e. none of the stuff below Basic/ export
   routines to each other and it still works!
 - changed occurences of foo(sig) to use '=for sig' as this seems to
   work better with Pod::Parser.
 - made random $x=random($y), i.e. to get inplace now random(inplace $y)
   OK?????????? This is because I think it is natural to say
   $r = random(zeroes(10,20,2)), etc.
   If this is a major headache let me know and I will change it back.
 - Docs => undef allowed - no PP docs at all (not even the sig)
 - Various changes to Docs.pm and Docs::Perldl.pm - apropos text searches
   now include module names and one-line desriptions. God I love this
   language.
 - Renamed Iutil module as ImageRGB - hope this is OK???
 - changed name of 'inv' to 'matinv' in Slatec for consistency
   with matmult in Primitive.

1.94_06

Christian:
  - lots of things.
Robin:
  - add type to PdlParObj.pm
Achim (req):
  - Version to Core.pm
Tjl:
  - New configuration.

1.94_05
... Not recorded. Real threading for example.

1.94_02

Lots of changes by everyone, e.g. FFT, Browser, ...

1.94_01

Christian:
  - simplescaler
  - VRML !!!

Achim:
  - misc.t patch
  - Browser hints

Karl:
  - autocreation memleak patch

Robin:
  - flexraw test correction

Jarle:
  - Ops.pd: prevent creation of -0

Tuomas:
  - Core bug fixes for e.g. $a->slice("...")->index(...) .= foo,
    originally reported by Christian.
  - mandel.pl demo

Others??

1.94

Kgb:
  - Autoload patch
  - subclass fixes: pdl_destroy + test.
  - sethdr + gethdr ref counts
  - rfits/wfits update

Christian:
  - where etc.
  - imag3d without lines

Kaj Wiik:
  - tsimp.pl use correction

Achim:
  - Tk patch

Tjl:
  - Change PP.pm to really allow Pars => 'a(tri=>3)' to happen.
    Embarrassingly, this was a one-liner.
  - OpenGL libs changed to take both GL and MesaGL.
  - openglq.pd: use tri=3
  - rout.pd ditto
  - TriD.pm: documentation updates & 'LINE' as context
  - Graph.pm: coordinate axes labels!
  - test7.pl: some niceties.
  - make the thread incs etc. into register variables.
    this should, with a good compiler, result in some speedup.
  - primitive.pd: histogram -> histogram + whistogram,
    more thread-friendly.
  - correct foo.t
  - TriD: add imag3d_ns (no surface) and minor twiddling.

1.93_06

Kgb:
  - PP: use PDLOBJ for the stub subs.
  - Basic.pm: sec, ins fixes - use "int" to ensure type of coords.
  - PG.pm fixes
  - IIS fixes

Achim:
  - ws fixes for docs, pptest.t
  - "small perldl fixes"

Tjl:
  - start making support for piddle-controlled (e.g. affine)
    transformations by using magic.
  - Core.xs: setdims should now work with dataflow properly.
  - Core.xs, pdl.h, pdlapi.h, PP.pm: add support for
    foofunctions and PDL::Trans objects. These are a very basic way
    of accessing the internals of transformations so that
    in the future, as the mechanism is improved,
    you can e.g. change your slice from outside.
    The current level of support is enough to make a routine
    that takes a slice of one dimension and is given offset and
    increment and n in that.
  - TriD:
     - add test8.pl to demonstrate an use of foofunctions.
     - document OpenGLQ and Rout
     - add gl_triangles_n for shaded triangles
     - TriD.pm:
        - realcoords: add more contexts
        - make the default routines all plot a graph
     - GL.pm:
        - add glPolygonOffset call to GL::Window in order to
	  get good-looking imag3d always
	- change the colors to somewhat lighter ones.
	- delete_viewports -> clear_viewports (like clear_objects)
	- new argument to twiddle
     - Graph.pm:
        - default names for dataseries
	- waffle less
	- support changed dataseries
     - Image.pm:
        - use realcoords COLOR context
     - Lines.pm:
        - start deprecation by renaming package
     - Objects.pm:
        - realcoords support better by r_type
	- waffle less
	- SLattice_S to draw shaded lattices
	- tests changed somewhat.
  - Core.xs: remove pdl_unpackint unnecessarity
  - Basic.pm: make axisvals return zeroes if not enough dimensions.
  - Opt/Simplex/Simplex.pm: add support for temperature a la
    Numerical Recipes.
  - (Christian) - remove Data::Dumper from FastRaw.

1.93_05

Tjl:
  - PP: several changes, basically inline *size and *incs into
    register variables to speed up execution.
  - TriD:
     - add TriD/Rout for misc C routines for TriD
        - add a routine to do flowing combination of 3 piddles into
          coordinates or colours
     - this makes the test3.pl data_changed stuff work again.
     - imagrgb now defaults to a whole-window image - no reason
       to make it rotatable with the mouse.

1.93_04

Tjl:
  - TriD: add stuff for Tk
    - OpenGL: ConnectionNumber
    - ButtonPress + Release: more info back
    - TriD.pm: add export imagrgb
    - Control3D: small changes + TriD::Tk::post_menu
    - GL.pm: ConnectionNumber support for Tk eventloop
    - Graph.pm: minor changes
    - Image.pm: major changes, make multi-D images actually work.
      also, support for different multi-D background color.
***** NOTE: calling convention now same as with coordinates!
      this means an incompatible change.
    - added Tk.pm, rudimentary support for a menu of actions
      associated with the displayed 3D graph. Currently, can save
      the image.
    - test3.pl: change to new imagrgb calling sequence.
    - GoBoard.pm: ditto
    - test6.pl: test the Tk functionality.
    - testimg.pl: really test the multidimensional picture facility
      with an 8-D tricolor picture.
  - Io/Pnm/Pic.pm: use the new 'Func' convention
  - perldl.PL: new '-tk' option to use Tk and the Tk event loop.

1.93_03

Tjl:
  - TriD:
     - Change default controller to ArcCone
     - Graphs with axes!
  - PP:
     - EquivDimCheck now honoured
  - iis.pd: #undef Generic
  - OpenGL/Makefile.PL update + generate.PL tuning
  - Browse: manpage twiddle

1.93_02

Tjl:
  - Core/Basic.pm: use PDL::Core qw/:Func/;
  - Core/Core.xs, pdl.h, pdlapi.h: hdr stuff (untested)
  - Core/Core.xs: bugfix threadover_n to make_physical
  - Core/pdlapi.c: pdl_destroy will not destroy if an affine trans the
    child of which hasn't been allocated exists.
  - Core/pdlapi.c: pdl_changed will not try to do overeager
    optimization. Fixes flow.t bug
  - Basic/t/flow.t: enable again the tests that now work.
  - Gen/PP.pm: new '$a = inner($b,$c)' changes.
  - Slices/slices.pd: splitdim checks arguments
  - Basic/t/thread.t: semi-add new test
  - Graphics/TriD/OpenGL: new PDL::OpenGL module to enable virtualization
  - Graphics/TriD/OpenGLQ: a test for TriD virtualization of OpenGL,
    this will later on expand a lot
  - Graphics/TriD/TriD.pm & TriD/*: new docs, small changes.
  - Io/Fastraw/FastRaw.pm: don't waffle when mmapping
  - MANIFEST.SKIP: add more ignorable stuff

KGB:

  - Fixed multiple 'use PDL' etc problem for loaders.
  - "use 5.004"

1.93_01 (Kgb) MAJOR CHANGES

- these are very significant and affect code throughout the
  system so EXPECT problems. In particular note that this code
  is the new PATCHBASE.

- NEW IMPORT/EXPORT system

  PDL_OO.pm now deleted.

  PDL::Exporter is DEAD and gone!! (hooray)

  All modules now define their functions in package PDL.

  The idea is a PDL::Module now looks like this:

    package PDL::Module;

    @EXPORT_OK  = qw( sub1 sub2 ...);
    %EXPORT_TAGS = (Func=>[@EXPORT_OK]);

    @ISA    = qw( Exporter ... );

    *sub1 = \&PDL::sub1;
    sub PDL::sub1 { ... def ...}

    # If you wanted to do something special (e.g. a constructor) you can:

    sub rfits(PDL->rfits(@_)); # This gets exported
    sub PDL::rfits {
      my $class = shift;
      # etc...
    }

  i.e. the onus is entirely on the module writer.

  Thus saying 'use PDL::Module' will load (cheaply) PDL methods.
  If you want to (less cheaply) import functions say 'use PDL::Module qw/:Func/'

  PP has been modified to generate modules which follow this scheme. i.e. by
  default it stuffs its functions in to the PDL namespace, and writes stubs
  '*sub1 = \&PDL::sub1;' into the PM file. This can be changed at whim
  however.  There is a new pp function - pp_bless('MyObj') which  will change the
  default package from "PDL" to 'MyObj' in anticipation of future
  Object-Oriented PP modules. (Up to the author how he writes his module).
  Also the pp_def(PMFunc=>'...') attribute can be used to generate special
  purpose PM code instead of the default.

  Comments please, hopefully nice ones as I have spent all day changing
  code everywhere and debugging!!!

  - Karl (exhausted)


- Module defaults

  PDL.pm now loads a set of standard packages (with :Func) - including graphics
  and I/O for TPJ article and v1.11 compatibility. Thus a script with 'use PDL'
  is v1.11 compatible (modulo bug fixes!)

  Lite.pm loads only the truly fundametal core, with no imports, for method
  speed freaks. Thus a lean script need only say 'use PDL::Lite' plus whatever
  else it needs.

  I hope various other sets of meta-modules (PDL::Astronomy, PDL::Medical) etc
  will follow this simple scheme. Basically there is nothing sacred about
  'use PDL' anymore - it is just one of many loaders.

- perldl shell

  The 'perldl' script sources C<~/.perldlrc> if present or falls back to
  C<PDL/default.perldlrc>. The latter just does the standard 'use PDL'

  Thus by creating a C<~/.perldlrc> you are free to 'use PDL::Lite' or
  whatever set of modules you fancy without impinging on v1.11 compatibility.

  I think this is a rather elegant solution to all our aesthetic tastes
  (namespace polluters vs method maniacs, module hoarders vs leany
  meanies) while still ensuring script compatibility with v1.11.

  I hope everyone is happy with this!

- Fixed minor bug in FlexRaw
