    Fixed bug number 2784016 in t/pic_16bit.t reported via
    rt.cpan.org.  I note that the Changes file might be replaced
    by the log list from git commits at some point.
CHM 23-Apr-2009
    Fixed test 17 in t/plplot.t to use a magnitude difference test
    rather than equality for the floating point quanitities.
CHM 22-Apr-2009
    Applied fix to t/autoload.t per the bug report sf bug #2339726
    by zowie.
CHM 22-Apr-2009
    Fixed bug #2753869 in the interpolation part of the pctover()
    routine in ufunc.pd.  The computation of pctover() and
    oddpctover() were corrected to improve consistency and
    agreement with other apps (e.g. MS Excel).
    and fixed the calculations of the pctover() and oddpctover()

    mkhtmldoc.pl: suddenly stopped making docs, preventing me from 
    executing "Make install".  Traced the problem down to a nonexistent
    directory in the POD scan path (".../HtmlDocs/pdl/PDL"), which for
    some reason is now crashing the POD builder stuff that came with 
    my MacOS-standard Perl.  Since .../pdl/PDL seems like a silly place to 
    look (the docs are build into just .../pdl), I dked out the "PDL" from
    the pod path, fixing the problem.
CED 10-3-2009
    Fix problem with reorder() - formerly required that all dimensions
    be set; now allows specification of a leading subset of dims in 
    the target.  Additional dims are threaded over (i.e. ignored).
SIS 25-2-2009
    Amend Basic/Math/math.pd so that Math.xs contains a prototype for
    the (distro version of) the rint function when (and only when) a
    Microsoft Compiler is being used. (Rev 1.17 of math.pd)
    This ifxes sourceforge bug 2630402.

    check release of final Makefile.PL mods.
DAL 05-Nov-2008 
    In top-level Makefile.PL: removed debugging print statement; moved
    @podpms back to 'pm' so tht the perldl and pdldoc script manuals
    appear in PDL::Index.
DCH 03-Nov-2008
    Added code to XS for PDL::Graphics::PLplot::plParseOpts to 
    avoid a segfault when it is called with no options.  Also added
    test case to plplot.t.
DCH 03-Nov-2008
    Took out MY::test subroutine in top-level Makefile.PL.
    This should restore the complete 'make test' functionality
    which now works properly after Craig Deforest's fix of 
    28-Oct-2008.
CHM 01-Nov-2008
    perldl.conf: changed default build options to enable bad
    value support and updated the Release_Notes to advertise
    the new capability.
    Basic/PDL.pm: updated VERSION to 2.4.3_05 which will be
    the official 2.4.4 release once the final updates are

    t/ufunc.t: fixed typo in conversion from is() to ok()
CHM 01-Nov-2008
    Basic/Core/pdlcore.c.PL: added case to support creation of
    longlong piddles with pdl_from_array from patch #2107905
    on the SF PDL site.  Thanks to Pete Ratzlaff.
CHM 01-Nov-2008
    Added dragonfly OS to list of BSD flavors requiring the
    -s flag to uudecode in IO/Dumper.pm.
CHM 31-Oct-2008
    Modified t/ufunc.t to use ok() and approximate numerical
    equality rather than string eq via is() for the tests.
DAL 29-Oct-2008
    Graphics/PLplot: changed Makefile.PL and plplot.pd so new 5.9.0
    (devel release) funcs aren't linked if older PLplot is installed.
SIS 29-Oct-2008
    Added a "sub MY::postamble{return ''}" to IO/Dicom/Makefile.PL
    to prevent the writing of a postamble section which was sometimes
    happening (with dmake only).
CED 28-Oct-2008
    Removed "Gen/pm_to_blib" dependence in Dev.pm - this should fix the 
    Makefile repeated-compile woes.  Added some explanatory notes in other
    Makefile.PL's.
CED 27-Oct-2008
    Update Autoload.pm to match bash's (advertised) ~ expansion: 
      - "~+" now expands to current working directory;
      - "~" now expands to $ENV{HOME} if present, *then* system-advertised
      	    home directory;
      - "~name" expands to system home dir for user "name" (previous behavior).
    No support for "~-", since Perl doesn't keep an $OLDPWD around.
SIS 27-Oct-2008
    Small fix to autoload.t so that it passes on Win32. (Only
    2 tests were planned for Win32, but 3 were being run.)
CHM 26-Oct-2008
    Modified t/bad.t test to use like() with a regexp rather
    than is() for some tests where the value returned had
    -0 and the test was checking with 0.
    Basic/PDL.pm: updated VERSION to 2.4.3_04
CHM 25-Oct-2008
    Basic/PDL.pm: update VERSION for PDL-2.4.4 pre-release 3
CHM 25-Oct-2008
    Makefile.PL: enabled bad value options when built within an
    automated testing framework such as used by CPAN Testers.
    This should improve the test coverage and allow us to better
    evaluate whether BADVAL can be enabled by default.
CHM 25-Oct-2008
    Lib/GIS/Proj/Makefile.PL: added trylink to verify PROJ4 version is
    recent enough, skip build otherwise.
    Makefile.PL: explicitly require 5.6.x or above perl version now.
CHM 25-Oct-2008
    t/autoloader.t, t/dumper.t: switched code from Test to Test::More and
    added better diagnostic messages in the hopes of tracking down the
    problems on darwin and freebsd.
CHM 22-Oct-2008
    t/inlinepdlpp.t: use non-standard Inline working directory for testing
    and force builds to fix problem with out-of-synch Inline cache and config
CHM 22-Oct-2008
    IO/Dumper.pm: the fix to use 'uudecode -s' with *bsd coming from bug #1573217
    does not apply to NetBSD as that uudecode does not strip leading slashes.
    Removed the "fix" code for the case of netbsd
DCH 22-Oct-2008
    Made change to MY::test to only run toplevel tests for 'make test'
    Do not attempt to build all of PDL, or attempt to look for and run subdirs tests.
    Also commented out some debug print statements in t/storable.t which caused warnings
    during 'make test'.
CHM 19-Oct-2008
    Basic/PDL.pm: change VERSION to 2.4.3_02 to indicate mods beyond
    the PDL-2.4.3_01 developers release just posted to CPAN

CHM 19-Oct-2008
    PDL/Graphics/TriD{TriD.pm,TriD/{ButtonControl.pm,Control3D.pm,GL.pm,Object.pm}}
    Removed explicit return calls in TriD constructors fixed to use
    fields::new() construction.  This was the original coding style
    and may be required for Lvalue subroutine support.  Tests still
    passed but in returning to the original usage without a return
    just in case for 2.4.4.
SIS 19-Oct-2008
    Switch off 3D in perldl.conf for Win32 (rev 1.49). Otherwise, the latest
    changes to Graphics/Makefile.PL break the build process for some versions
    of File::Find.
CHM 19-Oct-2008
    t/proj_transform.t: added test skip if PDL not configured with bad value
    support since the test appears to require bad value processing to succeed.
    This addresses sourceforge bug #2022265.
CHM 18-Oct-2008
    PDL::Graphics::Makefile.PL: folded in patch from rt.cpan.org PDL bug
    #30276 reporter which improves the logic for finding the xdpyinfo command
    for TriD configuration.  The sourceforge bug corresponding is #1994614.
CHM 18-Oct-2008 EDT
    PDL/Graphics/TriD{TriD.pm,TriD/{ButtonControl.pm,Control3D.pm,GL.pm,Object.pm}}
    Replaced direct FIELDS access in field based constructors with fields::new() to
    fix problem with 5.10 where the pseudohash implementation has been eliminated.
SIS 19-Oct-2008
    In Basic/Core/pdlthread.c, replace the few remaining malloc calls with Newx.
    (Rev 1.8)
DCH 17-Oct-2008
    Updated PLplot:  Added several new low-level functions, added the
    'stripplots' high level function.  Also enhanced the Makefile.PL
    to make the stand-alone version of PDL::Graphics::PLplot work better
    for CPAN installs.  Finally, applied a patch to Basic/Primitive/Makefile.PL
    to allow proper srand behavior, permitting the primitive.t tests to work.
CHM 14-Oct-2008
    perldl: Added FreeGLUT event loop support to perldl in analogy with
    the existing Tk event loop support.
SIS 12-Oct-2008
    Addition of link to bufferoverflowu.lib in CallExt.pm's callext_cc()
    for Windows x64 builds only (rev 1.9).
SIS 11-Oct-2008
    In top level Makefile.PL remove EU::F77 from PREREQ_PM, and fix 
    $PDL::Config{TEMPDIR}, which I broke for non-Windows systems with the 
    changes made on 8 Oct.(This latest change is rev 1.68 )
    Also a Windows-only change to Basic/Core/Dev.pm (rev 1.33) as part of the
    change to $PDL::Config{TEMPDIR}.
SIS 09-Oct-2008
    Amend Lib/Slatec/Makefile.PL (rev 1.17) so that '*make realclean' doesn't 
    clobber libg2c.a and libgcc.a when a Microsoft compiler is in use.
    Amend Lib/Minuit/Makefile.PL (rev 1.5), Basic/Core/pdl.h.PL (rev 1.13)
    and Basic/Gen/PP.pm (rev 1.49) to enable Minuit to build with Microsoft 
    compilers. (All of these changes should be invisible to other compilers.)
SIS 08-Oct-2008
    Amend top-level Makefile.PL so that File::Temp->tmpdir() is assigned to
    Config.pm's $PDL::Config{TEMPDIR}. (This is so that Windows PPM packages
    will function correctly). Rev 1.67
CHM 07-Oct-2008
    Basic/Core/Core.pm.PL: fixed alias creation to avoid compile warnings
CHM 07-Oct-2008
    Basic/Core/Core.pm.PL: Added zeros convenience aliases for zeroes.
    This is matches common American English and Matlab usages and is
    one letter shorter to type.
SIS 06-Oct-2008
    ExtUtils::F77->runtime not providing the required format for MSVC compilers.
    A minor fix put in place in Lib/Slatec/Makefile.PL to correct this. Rev 1.16
CHM 18-Sep-2008
    Lib/GSL/INTEG/FUNC.c, Lib/GSL/INTERP/gsl_interp.pd, Lib/GSL/MROOT/FUNC.c
    Quieted pointer cast compiler warnings by replacing with calls to the
    INT2PTR() macro of the Perl API.  This fixes sf.net tracker bug #1356282.
CHM 17-Sep-2008
    Lib/GSL/RNG/gsl_random.pd, Lib/GSL/RNG/typemap - added INT2PTR() macros
    to prevent typecast warnings (sourceforge bug tracker #1356282)
CHM 14-Sep-2008
    perldl.PL - added $PERLDL::HISTFILESIZE to control the number of lines
    history saved.  Updated docs and incremented VERSION to 1.34.
CHM 10-Sep-2008
    t/pic_16bit.t - Added test for pnmtopng with corresponding skips to prevent
    PDL test failure due to NetPBM not being installed with a diagnostic to
    point out the possible problem.
CHM 27-Jul-2008
    t/matrixops.t - Added tests for SF bug #2023711 as an active placeholder for
    the problem.  It was threading that allowed two piddles such as: [5,2] and
    [[5,2],[5,2]] to test as equal with a check such as abs($a - $b) since the
    result was [[0,0],[0,0]] with all elements suitably small...
CHM 20-Jul-2008
    IO/GD/GD.pd - Fixed warning messages about 'cast to pointer from integer
    of different size' by use of INT2PTR() and PTR2IV() Perl API macros rather
    that a raw typecast.  No warnings now and all tests still pass on cygwin.
CHM 19-Jul-2008
    Basic/Ufunc/ufunc.pd - Fixed bug #2019651 in the pctover() routine, some minor
    changes to the index calculations and some bounds checks to avoid out-of-range
    indexing problems.  Added a doc ref to the algorithm used.
    t/ufunc.t - added new test to verify the reported bug
CHM 19-Jul-2008
    Fixed Basic/Pod/FAQ.pod: updated version to 0.8 and added an entry on
    installing PDL into non-standard locations.  Yes, it is just a standard
    perl module in that respect but this should make it easier for first
    time perl users to configure.
CHM 19-Jul-2008

CHM 18-Jul-2008
    Proj.pd, Lib/GIS/Proj/Proj.pd, fix undefined reference to _pj_list.

    Makefile.PL - modified @exe_files and $cleanup to account for new pdl binary executable build location (bug 1747307)
DAL 17-Jun-2008
    Lib/Slatec/slatec.pd - avoided namespace collision with PDL::FFT.
    Basic/Matrix.pm - commented out buggy vcrossp & crossp functions. 
	Built-in crossp works fine for PDL::Matrix objects.
    Basic/Core/Basic.pm, Basic/Pod/Impatient.pod - finally removed docs error which said '~' overloaded transpose.

CED 6-Nov-2007
    PDL::AutoLoader - changed goto to a pass-through sub call, to avoid problems with 
	    autoload files that leave stuff on the stack (e.g. subs with Inline or XS definitions).
	    By not goto'ing, we avoid scrozzling the stack in such cases.
    PDL::NiceSlice - add some (masked-out) debug prints in perldlpp()
    perldl - make the acquire/filter/execute loop $_-safe by using $lines instead of $_ 
	    for all the central modifications.  Avoids problems with some AUTOLOAD 
	    functions that leaked $_.
CED 5-Nov-2007

    Small cleanup of the code that sets the temp directory in the top level
    Makefile.PL (rev 1.64). 
HG  15-Sep-2006
    Extend the 64bit-architecture test in t/flexraw.t and include ia64 in
	the blacklist
SIS 11-Sep-2006
    Enable building of GSL on Win32.
    Changes to Lib/GSL/DIFF/Makefile.PL (rev 1.3), Lib/GSL/INTEG/Makefile.PL 
    (rev 1.3), Lib/GSL/INTERP/Makefile.PL (rev 1.3), Lib/GSL/RNG/Makefile.PL
    (rev 1.5), Lib/GSL/SF/Makefile.PL (rev 1.5), Lib/GSL/MROOT/Makefile.PL rev 1.2.
    Also needed a slight tweak to Basic/Core/Dev.pm's pdlpp_stdargs_int (rev 1.32).   
DJB 07-Sep-2006
    Continued work on Basic/Gen/PP.pm (revision 1.48). This deals with the old
    subst_makecomp routine moving to PDL::PP::Rule::MakeComp.
    Added an explicit test of assgn to t/bad.t
    Converted t/gsl_interp.t to use Test::More.
DJB 06-Sep-2006
    Converted t/gsl_mroot.t to use Test::More and fixed a bug that
    caused it to fail when PDL::GSL::MROOT is not installed.
DJB 02-Sep-2006
    Continued work on Basic/Gen/PP.pm (revision 1.47)
AJ  01-Sep-2006
    Added PDL::GSL::MROOT
SIS 1-Sep-2006
    Remove dmake clause from pdlpp_postamble() in Basic/Core/Dev.pm.    
    Revision 1.31.    
DJB 31-Aug-2006
    Re-worked Basic/Gen/PP.pm to use objects for the $PDL::PP::deftbl
    array rather than array references, since using objects just has
    to make things easier to read :-) There should be purely an internal
    change. This is revision 1.46.
    Basic/Gen/PP/PDLCode.pm has also seen a few minor changes (again
    purely internal). This is revision 1.7
CHM 24-Aug-2006
    Fix qsortvec function resolving bug #1544590 on sourceforge.
    Really need to add tests corresponding to bugs with the fixes.
    TBD.
SIS 25-Aug-2006
    Remove the 'goto' in Graphics/IIS/Makefile.PL - was causing a problem
    on some builds of Win32 perl. (Revision 1.2)
DJB 24-Aug-2006
    Changed Basic/Gen/PP.pm so that it is now all run under ;use strict'.
    There should only be an internal change (this is revision 1.45)
DAL 22-Aug-2006
    Fixed a minor typo in FAQ.pod and a small doc change to Fit::Gaussian.
DJB 22-Aug-2006
    Cleaned up t/slice.t to use Test::More. This was in an attempt
    to help track down the message reported during 'make test':
    "(in cleanup) index out-of-bounds in range during global destruction."
    However, the conversion seems to have removed this message...
CHM 20-Aug-2006
    Merged 2.4.3 development fixes into main CVS trunk.
CHM 17-Aug-2006
    Updated rel_2_4_3pre_branch with debian fixes by HG and
    added the decided upon fix for HDF/Makefile.PL for the
    PM location.
CHM 16-Aug-2006
    perldl.conf, IO/FITS/FITS.pm
    - fixes for $PDL::Config{FITS_LEGACY} to turn off all
      the zillion Astro::FITS::Header warning messages
    Graphics/Makefile.PL
    - fix GLX test not to ignore user forced WITH_3D=>1
    cygwin/INSTALL, cygwin/README
    - update some of the cygwin/ install notes based on
      recent testing and module fixes
    will be tagging these fixes as rel_2_4_3pre2
CHM 14-Aug-2006
    Touch up top level documentation files and add some config
    files to PDL/cygwin/.  Files changed: BUGS, COPYING,
    DEPENDENCIES, DEVELOPMENT, INSTALL, Known_problems, README,
    Release_Notes, cygwin/INSTALL, cygwin/README.
CED 13-Aug-2006
    Fixed typo with CI_J matrix declaration in t_fits code
    (transform.pd); allows use of CI_J matrices in FITS headers as per 
    the newer WCS standard) 
CED 13-Aug-2006
    - Minor fixes to Transform -- t_fits CI_J header notation;
      also: dims copied between params and main object in 
      t_spherical and t_projective.
CHM 11-Aug-2006
    - Added Astro::FITS::Header as a PREREQ_PM in main Makefile.PL
    - Added to DEPENDENCY file list
    - Put preliminary notes on how to migrate an externally
      developed PDL module into the source tree for distribution
      with PDL
CHM 11-Aug-2006
    Fix Graphics/Makefile.PL be more conservative in deciding to
    build OpenGL and TriD when WITH_3D => undef. Now choose not
    to build if the xdpyinfo command does not indicate available
    GLX extensions for the current X server display.  This
    should prevent test failures due to some OpenGL X config
    problems.
DCH 10-Aug-2006
    Changed slatec.t test from:
    ## Test: chia
    $x = float( sequence(11) - 0.3 );
    to
    ## Test: chia
    $x = double( sequence(11) - 0.3 );
    This allows this test to work on a 64 bit machine (AMD x86_64)
    Also, skip the flexraw.t tests for x86_64 (these tests only
    apply to 32 bit machines)
DCH 10-Aug-2006
    Changed from $ENV{HOSTTYPE} to $Config{archname} for x86_64 check
    in order to set -fPIC compiler flag.
CHM 09-Aug-2006
    Updated Known_problems and minor doc fix.
CHM 08-Aug-2006
    Fixed t/proj_transform.t to skip_all if WITH_BADVAL not set so
    with Judd Taylor fixes from earlier today all PROJ4 modules
    now build and test on PDLrc1.  Thanks all for testing a fixes!
DAL 01-Aug-2006
    Fixed typo in t_spherical of transform.pd (closes bug 1530666).
CHM 30-Jul-2006
    Updated release notes in preparation for 2.4.3 release.
    Known_Problems will follow.
CHM 27-Jul-2006
    Created cygwin/ directory with first drafts of README and
    INSTALL files for Cygwin users.
CHM 26-Jul-2006
    Minor wording changes to skip_all messages for test output
    to improve readability.
DJB 24-Jul-2006
    Fix for valgrind-detected error when WITH_BADVAL option selected.
    There was an invalid read due to $PRIV(bvalflag) being checked after
    $PRIV() was invalidated (by a call to PDL->make_trans_mutual).
    The code changes (e.g. see copybadstatus in PP.pm) indicate there is
    some future code cleanup/optimisations that could be made, but leave
    for post 2.4.3 work.

    Stop the "re-defining PERL_UNUSED_DECL" warnings from perl 5.8.8 by
    updating the ppport.h from the latest Devel::PPPort (v3.09). Removed
    ppport.h copy in Graphics/PGPLOT/Window/.
DJB 22-Jul-2006
    Fix to pdlcore.h.PL to avoid valgrind warning: rev1.26 put the
    setting of the debug_flag inside an ifdef but the variable is used
    to decide whether to print out a warning about pdl_setav_<type>
    converting undef's to $PDL::undefval. Easiest solution is to remove
    the ifdef (could have removed the use of debug_flag in the if statement
    instead).
CED 18-Jul-2006
	- PDL.pm: added help cross-reference to pdl()
	- t/core.t: add three constructor tests
	- pdlcore.c.PL: Fix a more obscure problem with constructor
	- pdlcore.c.PL: Fix problem with constructor 
		(pdl( zeroes(100), ones(10)) case)
DJB 10-Jul-2006
    Fix up compile warnings in Core/ seen on Solaris
    - moved pdl_freedata from pdlhash.c to Core.xs.PL
    - added pdl__print_magic to pdlmagic.h (for pdlapi.c)
    - include sys/mman.h for pdlmagic.c (if USE_MMAP defined)
    Minor pod fixes to primitive.pd
CHM 09-Jul-2006
         Fix skip_all output for t/fftw.t and plplot.t.
CHM 08-Jul-2006
         Update flexraw.t, gd_oo_tests.t, gd_tests.t,
    gis_proj.t, hdf_sd.t, hdf_vdata.t, hdf_vgroup.t,
    inlinepdlpp.t, ndf.t, pgplot.t, and proj_transform.t
    test scripts to use Test:More and skip_all to report
    when a test is completely skipped due to major
    functionality missing or not available.
         The original skip method was to reduce the number
    of planned tests to 1 and then to skip that *single*
    test (subtest, actually).  It was not possible to
    tell from the "make test" harness output that the
    functionality being tested was not available at
    all or even installed!
         These changes set the plan output for these
    missing functionality tests being skipped to "1..0"
    which is reported as "<testfile>...skipped" followed
    by "all skipped: <explanation>" The output from
    "make test" now indicates if something is missing
    from the build/install.
DJB 29-Jun-2006
    Updated $pdl_core_version in pdlcore.h.PL to 6 since the code for the
    experimental BADVAL_PER_PDL feature added fields to the Core struct
    (see 'pdldoc Internals' for info on why the variable needs to be
    updated).
    *** Warning: this means that - once this change is built and
    installed - any external module that uses the C interface of PDL will
    have to be re-built/installed (they'll complain and refuse to run until
    you do so).
DAL (24-Jun-2006)
    Added FAQ question (#6.22) showing how to get PGPLOT to write PNG files.
    Also updated the CVS commands in the FAQ.
HG  (22-Jun-2006)
    Fix the TriD::OpenGL build issue with newer X installations by 
    importing Bill Coffman's patch for Graphics/TriD/OpenGL/opengl.pd
    (closes bug #1505132)
DJB 20-Jun-2006
    Attempt to clean up building of Basic/MatrixOps:
      - fix a nan issue on Solaris (use atof("NaN") ratehr than nan(""))
      - moved source code from ssl/ sub-directory into parent so that
        we do not have to try and write our own Makefile for these
        files (with attendant OS/system complexities) but let Perl
        worry about it all
DJB 19-Jun-2006
    The experimental BADVAL_PER_PDL feature can not (currently) be
    combined with BADVAL_USENAN. The build now detects this conflict
    and turns off BADVAL_USENAN. The docs need updating to discuss
    this option!
CED (16-Jun-2006)
    Work around -0 problem on macOS 10.4 PPC: some numbers (notably 
    constructions of the form "pdl( 5 ) % 5") yield a value of 
    "-0" rather than "0" under that OS.  Fix is in the pdl_at routine 
    in core/pdlsections.g: forces 'c'-false values to be truly 0 during
    export to perl.  The hack is accomplished via -DMACOS_MZERO_BRAINDAMAGE,
    so the (infinitesimal) CPU cost doesn't affect other platforms.
CHM (12-Jun-2006)
    Fix to GD portion [only] re sourceforge bug #1493056:
    - Replace pdlpp_postamble() call in PDL/IO/GD/Makefile.PL with the
      same call to pdlpp_postamble_int().  Don't know the details but this
      puts the right blib path includes for PDL::IO::GD to build on clean
      perl (no previous PDL install).
    - Removed "use PDL;" from GD.pd which broke the GD build process
      without a pre-existing PDL install.
    - Removed cygwin workaround for WITH_GD setting in perldl.conf.
CED (6-Jun-2006)
    (finally) fix TriD rotation bug.  What an evil crock that module is!
CED (4-Jun-2006)
    Fix Makefile.PL for Proj -- now doesn't attempt to build proj modules
    when proj is not present on the system.
CHM (30-May-2006)
    Fix t/flexraw.t to use eval to prevent a missing IO::String module
    from preventing the test to run.  IO::String is required for perls
    before 5.8.0.  The perlio for 5.8.0 and later perls supports the
    same functionality with the native open call.
CHM (29-May-2006)
    Fix perl Makefile.PL build process to allow TriD (OpenGL) to build on
    cygwin.
      - Graphics/Makefile.PL -- set OPENGL_LIBS, OPENGL_DEFINE, OPENGL_INC
      - Graphics/TriD/Makefile.PL -- add *.dll.a to @patterns to test
    Cygwin now builds out of the box with base modules and TriD(OpenGL)
    and PLplot (need to have plplot bin directory in PATH for tests to
    pass).
CHM (28-May-2006)
    Fix Graphics/PLplot/Makefile.PL to allow plplot to build on cygwin.
Chris Marshall-a.k.a. CHM or marshallch (28-May-2006)
    Updated Changes file to reflect CVS submissions on 22-May-2006 to
    incorporate accumulated patches to allow PDL to build on cygwin
    unix environment.  The patches close bug 1093510 and affect the
    following files:
        - Makefile.PL (fixed to specify .exe extension for binary file installs)
        - Lib/GSL/SF/coulomb/gsl_sf_coulomb.pd  (fixed typo)
        - Lib/GSL/SF/poly/gsl_sf_poly.pd        (fixed typo)
        - t/flexraw.t  (added line wrap into f77 continuation lines to handle cases
            where lines longer than 72 chars were being generated; worked around a
            problem with a subtest using the compress command---on cygwin this is a
            non-functional "reminder" script---gzip was used instead)
        - perldl.conf (set cygwin default to skip new GD and Proj modules until a
            build issue can be investigated, a bug report has been submitted)
    Base PDL now builds with the default CVS code.  Work continues to fix issues
    with TriD(OpenGL), PLplot, FFTW, and PGPLOT.
JT  (12-Apr-2006)
    Added the PDL::IO::GD module, and tests.
JT  (5-Apr-2006)
    Added the PDL::GIS::Proj and PDL::Transform::Proj4 modules and
    matching tests to t/ directory.
DAL (5-Apr-2006)
     FAQ update. Perl/PDL versions, links, etc.  No new questions added. 
     Fixes bug 88964.
SIS (2-Apr-2006)
     Fix bug that in Lib/Slatec/Makefile.PL that could prevent the
     Makefile from being written.
     Have Basic/Core/Dev.pm's pdlpp_postamble() return nothing for dmake.
     (A call to pdlpp_postamble() was breaking dmake - but dmake has not yet
     needed such a postamble anyway.)
JT (29-Mar-2006)
    Added in the PDL::IO::HDF module, version 2.0, which has been
    extensively reworked (see the Changes doc in that dir for more
    info on those changes). Added new entries to the perldl.conf file, 
    modified some of the Makefile.PL's to have that build, and added
    test files to the t/ directory.
    This also fixes bugs 1432707 and 1432720.

JLC (23-Mar-2006)
     Fixed bug in PDL::Complex::initialize that caused problems when
     using PDL->cat with PDL::Complex objects. Added to the complex.t
     test case to check for this condition.
SIS (21-Mar-2006)
      'use blib;' added to Demos/BAD_demo.pm.PL and Demos/BAD2_demo.pm.PL to work around
      EU::MM-6.30 bug.
SIS (19-Mar-2006)
      Alteration to Basic/Core/Makefile.PL to enable proper inclusion
      of badvalues on nmake-built PDL (Win32 only).
SIS (18-Mar-2006)
      Small change to Basic/Core/Core.xs.PL's at_bad_c function so
      it will compile with Microsoft compilers.
CED (17-Mar-2006)
    Test & Incorporate patch 1093515 - Marshall's fits.t mod 
    Test & Incorporate patch 1095517 - Klein's badval support
    Test & Incorporate patch 1099405 - Klein's per-PDL badval support.
        (per-PDL badval support currently breaks the test suite and should be
        considered experimental only.)
    Remove debugging lines from 1151418 fix (yesterday)
CED (16-Mar-2006)
    Fix bug 1176634 (zeroes/ones from derived classes, e.g. Complex)
    Test & Incorporate patch 1176619 (formatting of Complex values)
CED (15-Mar-2006)
    Fix bug 1151418, problems with bad values in matrix multiplication (actually inner).
    Also: try to debug slatec under 64 bits...
CED (14-Mar-2006)
    IO/Dumper.pm: Fix bug in dumper.t in UU:convert-only case
    t/slatec.t: instrument Slatec test 
DAL (14-Mar-2006) 
      In Primitive.pd, the uniq family of functions now behave properly when 
      the input piddle has bad values.
CED (10-Mar-2006)
    1338982 (obscure bug reading a FITS file)
    1220830 (problems with $#$-type scalars in SvPDLV)
        - take 2
CED (10-Mar-2006)
  Fixed bugs:
    1435138 (problems with compress on Suse 9.3)
    1386260 (installation fixes for 64bit linux)
    1350149 (fatal typo in Graphic::TriD::Rout)
    1350130 (conflicting defines in Graphics/IIS)
    1262194 (bad quoting in Core/Dev.pm require statment)
    1209924 (range() truncate is not setting values bad when truncating)
CED (9-Mar-2006) 
    Finished fixing the TriD code.  The problem had to do with the 
    codewalker that harvests function definitions and typedefs from the
    GL header files. The solution involves passing the header files through
    the C preprocessor to handle compile-time switching, autogenerating
    simple typemap declarations from typedefs, and fencing the header
    files so that function definitions from included files are not
    detected by the harvester.  Blech.  Someone really needs to overhaul
    this stuff.  I really hope it's not me.
CED (8-Mar-2006) Added -fPIC to Makefile.PL on 64-bit platforms;
    attempted to make TriD work on 64 bit platforms (not yet successful --
    will check in fix later).
SIS (14-Feb-2006) Changes to top level Makefile.PL, Core/Basic/Makefile.PL, and 
    Core/Gen/Makefile.PL to override EU::MM's processPL() which is continually being 
    broken on Win32.
    Also rewrite limits_normalize_dsets.t so that it's not broken by Test::More bug.
DAL (12-Jan-2006) Set correct x-y bounds for circle in PGPLOT/Window.pm.
    Added function tcircle based on tpoints and tline.
    Fixed convolveND method selection, bug #1323973.
    Fixed docs (usage and signature) bug in statsover to show correct number and order of returned quantities.
SIS (8-SEP-2005) Enter Chris Marshall's patched version of t/limits_keyspecs.t.
    Fixes one of the #1221742 bugs. 
CED (1-Aug-2005) update docs for PDL.pm; re-fix recursion error message
HG (2-June-2005) Fix PLplot's Makefile.PL to clean up temporary files
HG (2-June-2005) add 'clean' and 'realclean' targets to the non-windows version
   of Basic/MatrixOps/ssl/Makefile
HG (2-June-2005) remove the now unneeded debian/patches/10_fix_clean_target.dpatch
HG (1-June-2005) Apply most of the 'make clean' from 
   debian/patches/10_fix_clean_target.dpatch
HG (1-June-2005) Apply debian/patches/50_relative_paths_in_htmldoc.dpatch, which 
   changes paths in HTML docs to relative instead of absolute ones.
HG (1-June-2005) Apply debian/patches/20_dont_overwrite_pdl_1p.dpatch, which prevents
   pdl.1p (generated from Basic/Pod/Intro.pod) being overwritten by autogenerated 
   pdl.1p from pdl.PL
DCH (31-May-2005) Added limited bad value support to gsl_interp.pd.  Added badval
                  test case to t/gsl_interp.t
CED (19-May-2005) Fixed minor bug in Windows.pm, updated MANIFEST to 
    remove Debian patches (so "make dist" works), smoothed demos
    a bit.
AJ (10-May-2005) Modified gsl_interp.pd and gsl_random.pd to pass pointers
   as IVs in OtherPars following Judd Taylor's suggestion.
JB (9-May 2005) Added set operation routines - setops in primitive.pd as well as 
   intersect which is just an alias. Also updated the docs so that apropos threshold
   will bring up clip..
JB (6-May-2005) Improved version of typemap handling in OtherPars in PP.pm checked in and
   documentation for PP updated to include a discussion of typemap handling
   in OtherPars. I also realised I forgot a few updates earlier: I fixed a 
   problem in the FITS reader which kept you from reading in only the header
   from files with empty primary arrays. And a few other small bug fixes around.
   I am awful at Changelogs....
HG (3-May-2005)
   Apply some of the 'make clean' fixes from debian/patches
SIS (2-May-2005)
   Fix Slatec/Makefile.PL so that it doesn't break for Win32 users
   building with MS compilers and f2c.
HG (1-May-2005)
   Remove debian-patches which are already in PDL cvs
HG (1-May-2005)
   Fix MANIFEST to include the current debian/* files
HG (30-Apr-2005)
   Apply debian/patches/60_remove_obsolete_upstream_debian_files.dpatch 
   and remove the file
CED (19-Apr-2005)
    Checked in Alexey Tourbin's patch in rout.pd
SIS (9-Apr-2005)
   In perldl.PL, set $HOME more appropriately for Win32.
CED (7-Apr-2005)
   Added warning message to FITS module load, if Astro::FITS::Header is not
   available.
AJ (01-Apr-2005)
   Modified PDL::GSL::INTEG to enable the calculation of nested integrals
DJB 9-Mar-2005
   Fixed dumn mistake in wfits docs I made; it is TTYPE<n> and not
   TFORM<n> that are used to specify the order of columns in FITS tables!
CED 9-Mar-2005
   pdl.h, pdlapi.c: Added guardrails to the dependency-loop
   detector.  (1) error message is now more explanatory. 
   (2) the detector now resets its counter when tripped, so that
   you can continue to use PDL once it has been activated.  (formerly,
   every operation following a trip caused another error message).
SIS 28-Feb-2005
   At last - a fix for the MakeMaker bug affecting dmake (Win32). No
   longer any need for the ugly hack that enabled PDL to be built with
   dmake. Deleted one line of code from the top level Makefile.PL.
   Deleted several lines from Basic/Core/Makefile.PL and added a sub
   MY::processPL and a sub MY::postamble for dmake. Fix supplied
   by Steve Hay.
DJB 23-Feb-2005 (EST)
   t/pgplot.t now uses $PGPLOT_DEV to set the output device, falling
   back to "/xw", rather than forcing "/xw".
   Cleaned up t/pgplot.t (no new real functionality) other than above.
CS 24-Feb-2005
   Remove 'use UNIVERSAL' for Core.pm.PL; shouldn't be needed anyway
   and gave strange import problems when using PDL with Net::SSH::Perl;
   also needed a change of isa to UNIVERSAL::isa in Dbg.pm
SIS 23-FEB-2005
   Another small tweak to Basic/Core/Makefie.PL to improve the hack that
   enables PDL to be built using dmake (Win32).
   Amend Basic/Core/pdlcore.c.PL to cater for "finite" with Microsoft
   compilers. This correction pointed out by Vanuxem Gregory - thanks Greg.
SIS 14-FEB-2005
   Minor alteration Basic/Core/Makefile.PL to address a MakeMaker bug.
   (Users now don't need to edit MM_Win32.pm.) Minor alterations regarding
   definition and usage of TESTTYPE() macro with Microsoft compilers
   in pdlcore.c.PL. Update win32/INSTALL to reflect changes.
SIS 12-FEB-2005
   Tidy up some things relating to Win32. All alterations of a minor nature.
   Files affected were Makefile.PL, Basic/Core/Dev.pm, Basic/Core/Makefile.PL,
   Basic/MatrixOps/ssl/Makefile.PL and win32/INSTALL.
SIS 10-FEB-2005
   Another change to Basic/Core/Makefile.PL to simplify build procedure
   on Win32.
SIS 6-FEB-2005
   Minor changes to Basic/Core/Makefile.PL, Basic/Core/Dev.pm, and the
   top level Makefile.PL to simplify build requirements/procedures
   on Win32.
SIS 5-FEB-2005
   Provide an alternative TESTTYPE() macro (in pdlcore.c.PL)for
   Microsoft compilers. (Addresses failures in conv.t and matrixops.t
   tests.)
SIS 4-FEB-2005
   Enact some minor changes in the following files so that PDL will
   build on Win32:
   pdl.PL, Makefile.PL
   Basic/MatrixOps/matrixops.pd
   Basic/MatrixOps/ssl/Makefile.PL
   Lib/CallExt/CallExt.pm
   Lib/Slatec/Makefile.PL
   t/callext.t, t/croak.t, t/flexraw.t, t/matrixops.t
   win32/INSTALL (Rewrite to reflect changes in build procedure)
CED 1-Feb-2005
   Fixed minor bug in convolveND with kernel threading
CED 18-Jan-2005
   pdlcore.c.PL: fixed a pointer arithmetic issue that was causing
   trouble under Windows.  Thanks, Sisyphus!
CED 18-Jan-2005
   - added segfault.t to test suite
CED 16-Jan-2005
   - pdlcore.c.PL: Following Alexey Tourbin's awesome research,
   removed a segfault problem when foreign blessed objects are pdlified.
   Now, SvPDLV croaks if a foreign blessed object is detected
   (avoiding a segfault); but stay tuned: there might be a better
   answer in this case.
CED 13-Jan-2005
   - transform.pd: remove typo introduced in removal of C double types
   (thanks, Henning!)
CED 09-Jan-2005
   - Core.pm.PL: Restored original barf behavior: reports error where
     it occured in user code, not within PDL.
   - primitive.pd: Matrix multiplication now requires that the second
     argument's second dim equal the first argument's first dim 
     (as required for matrix multiplication; previous threading case
     made no sense).
   - Core.pm.PL: restored barf() to its documented behavior (had been
     commented out and replaced with Carp::croak()...)
   - t/matmult.t, t/misc.t: added more matrix multiplication tests; 
     fixed test in misc.t to accept error messages with "PDL:" in front.
    
CED 07-Jan-2005
   - Updated PDL version to '2.4.2cvs'
   - In a fit of insomnia, lifted code for non-symmetric eigenvalue
      problems from Kenneth Geisshirt.  (http://kenneth.geisshirt.dk).
      Resolves bug 1098245 and gets a long-standing annoyance off my back.
DJB 06-Jan-2005
   - Fixed norm() to correctly handle bad values. Added test case to bad.t
     (and changed to use Test::More rather than Test module and
      PDL::Core::approx).
DJB 28-Dec-2004
   - Clean up of t/fftw.t (use Test::More and PDL::Core::approx()). Small
     increase in the tolerance used for checks (1.1e-4 to 1.2e-4) to avoid
     occasional test failures seen on Solaris.

2.4.2 released 28-Dec-2004

CED 27-Dec-2004
   - Window.pm: fixed bug 1091534 (problem with rect())
DJB 23-Dec-2004
   - Set the WITH_3D option in perldl.conf to be 0 rather than undef on OS-X
     since there are still problems with the build. Also added a path to the
     GL headers to Graphics/Makefile.PL and opengl.pd for OS-X (in case the
     problem gets fixed). I think the whole build process for the 3D stuff
     should be re-worked if anyone has enough tuit's.
CED 17-Dec-2004
   - PDL 5.6 is now deprecated by the Makefile.PL
   - Fix problems with test suite when Astro::FITS::Heder is not installed.
CED 13-Dec-2004
   - uninitialized memory patch 1083663 (thanks, Miloslav!)

CED 11-Dec-2004
   - transform.pd: added projective transforms (t_projective)
   - slices.pd: added Miloslav's patch (patch #1083663)
   
CED 4-Dec-2004
   - DiskCache.pm: Fixed problem with syncing to disk on store (typo in code)
   - Lib/Opt/Simplex.pm: Fixed bug 1057022 (Opt::Simplex bug; thanks, Marcus)
   - slatec.pd: Fixed bug 1076817 (matinv doesn't thread).
                Fixed bug 1075203 (trailing underscores; thanks, Luc).
   - Makefile.PL: Made bad-@INC problems more apparent when found.
     ('.' at front of @INC causes trouble for build; this is now detected
     and the user gets warned.)
DJB 28-Oct-04
   - removed some header comments which caused problems with (presumably older)
     versions of Astro::FITS::Header (for PDL::IO::FITS::wfits)
DJB 27-Oct-04
   - fixed wfits() to write out ushort columns as Int4 (J) format
     (ideally we should write out as Int4 (I) and use TSCALE/ZERO).
     Added tests for this and other column types. Removed support for
     writing out PDL::Complex piddles for this release.
   - cleaned up the limits* tests so that they are skipped if PDL::Slatec
     is not installed.
DJB 21-Oct-04
   - clean up of code to fix remaining validation errors reported by fverify
     (the Type value passed to Astro::FITS::Header::Item must be in upper
     case to get correct format for each card). Not 100% convinced caught all
     cases.
DJB 20-Oct-04
   - PDL::IO::FITS::wfits updates for table writing: BITPIX must be the second
     card (or else fverify from FTOOLS throws a wobbly); fixed writing a
     comment card (caused messages under use strict/-w); the data area is
     now filled with \0 rather than " " (both tables and images).
     Note that fverify still complains that the keywords are not written
     out correctly (the comments do not start in column #32 I think).
     Removed the use of the FITS file handle from the whole module (now uses
     IO::File throughout).
     Added some very basic table tests to t/fits.t.
CED 15-Oct-04
   - fix a few oddball cases in permissive constructor
CS  07-Oct-04
   - fix warnings in some test scripts
DJB 06-Oct-04
   - PDL::Graphics::PLplot doc. updates: include internal and external links;
     use of head3 elements for options; added blank lines between pod
     statements (if not included these statements are treated as text);
     addition of "extra" markup (C<> and F<> items).
CED 17-Sep-04
   - primitive.pd: stats updated to use statsover for better agreement
   - statsover modified to promote mean etc. to floating-point.
   - removed "$temp" magic variable from perldl -- now it's only available in 
     the "PERLDL" package.  (assigning to $temp crashed perldl; this fixes that.)
CS 15-Sep-04
   - complex.pd: applied Vanuxem Grgory's patch and added some tests;
                 should close bug 1010164
CED 15-Sep-04
   - primitive.pd: Fix to statsover
   - Makefile.PL, etc.: Added HTML_DOCS configuration option
   - Fixed non-portability issue in t/diskcache.t
CS  07-Sep-04
   - make the reduce function a bit more flexible: reduce over
     list of dims and allow code references
CED 19-Aug-04
   - Fixed OpenGL build to work with Mandrake 10 (this will need
     better fixing later, but should work OK with all current distros).
DCH 30-Jul-04
   - Cleaned up plplot.t a bit.  Made compilation of plplot routines
     plsvect and plvect dependent upon a recent enough version of plplot.
DCH 29-Jul-04
   - Cleanup in plplot.d.  Fixed documentation bug 959902.  Fixed line
     width specification (LINEWIDTH option).  Fixed test bug in
     limits_ulimits.t (floating point comparison error in array_eq)
CED 29-Jul-04
   - Fixed Makefile.PL for PLPlot, to pay attention to $PDL::Config hash
    (was checking $PDL_CONFIG instead).  Ditto plplot.t
DJB 29-Jul-04
   - added tests to t/core.t for $PDL::undefval fix (bug#886263 fixed
     by Craig) and cleaned up the test to use Test::More (was Test).
CED 28-Jul-04
   - updated constructor and conversion routines to handle 
     $PDL::undefval properly.  Since I don't like
     action-at-a-distance, I also added tripwires to this activity
     if $PDL::debug is set -- hopefully that mitigates the horror 
     somewhat.
CED 21-Jul-04
   - changes to perldl.PL to allow script handling.
   - introducing "pdl", a byte-compiled trampoline that spawns off a perldl.
    "pdl"'s advantages: (a) it's two characters shorter to type,
    and (b) you can use in in a shebang.
CED 15-Jul-04
   - Modified flexraw.t test to not overrun 80-column card images
     for reasonably sized file names (it will still break if fed a file
     name that is unreasonable).
CED 07-Jul-04
   - Modified Pic.pm to look for alternate JPEG converters where
   appropriate.  This allows use of netpbm instead of pbmplus.
DJB 01-Jul-04
   - pdlcore.c.PL/pdl_kludge_copy_<>() issues: changed \n to \\n in some error
     messages (would not compile otherwise) and a switch statement is now
     auto-generated from %PDL::Types::typehash rather than hard-coded
CED 17-Jun-04
   - pdlcore.c.PL: av_ndcheck and pdl_setav_$type now support PDLs thrown
    into the mix. 

    I noticed that PDL::undefval doesn't seem to function (see
    "help pdl[2]") but  left it that way for philosophical reasons.
CED 16-Jun-04
   - perldl.PL: comment lines are filtered out before passing through 
    Text::Balanced, and quotelike operators (e.g. "s/foo/bar/" or
    "qq/foo/") are ignored for line parsing.  Those constructs 
    rarely cross lines in common usage, and they cause lots of trouble
    with Text::Balanced.
CED 1-Jun-04
   - PP.pm: fixed deep header copying -- now neither crashes nor leaks memory.
   - slices.pd - added a paragraph to the range() documentation
   - FITS.pm - added a couple of minor notes to the rfits() documentation.
CED 28-May-04
   - primitive.pd: fixes to glue()
DJ  21-May-04
   - added Graphics::Limits, which determines display ranges for
     multiple concurrent data sets
   - Primitive: fix to which/which_both bad value code to make it work when 
     BADVAL_USENAN = 1
CED 30-Apr-04
   - perldl: warns if AutoLoader is not loaded by perldlrc; avoids
     a suite of installation follies.
   - FITS.pm: rfits() clears hdrcpy flag by default
   - pdlapi.c, PP.pm: minor readability cleanup
   - Core.pm.PL: introducing hcpy, a pass-through hdrcpy clone.  Also,
    minor fixes to deep copying.  Deep header copying still leaks
    memory; it's not (yet) obvious why.  [ Removing the refcnt increment
    in PP.pm causes crashes, so, er, that's not it. ]
CED 15-Apr-04
   - FITS.pm: minor fix for all-BAD case.
CED 08-Apr-04
   - NiceSlice.pm, Core.pm.PL: added dummy syntax to NiceSlice.
   - slices.pd: minor improvements to documentation
CED 04-04-04 (heh).
   - slices.pd: range - Added extra speedbump to avoid common programming error
      (more than five implicit dims throws a warning)
   - transform.pd: map - Added some extra dimensionality checks
CED 26-Mar-04
   - Primitive: which() now ignores bad-value entries (before it always
    selected the BAD value).
   - Primitive: uniqvec() now works properly if you feed in a lone vector.
   - added tests for these cases.
CED 17-Mar-04
   - Transform:  added match() convenience routine
   - Demos:  added a rotating-coordinate-system demo to "demo transform"
   - Window.pm: fixed up _fits_tr to actually line up right with the FITS
    coordinate system.
   - Doc::Perldl.pm: fix for perl 5.8.0 compatibility (string interpolation
     is a little more agressive in the earlier versions)
DJB 17-Mar-04
   - Updated PLplot build so that it works on OS-X, and will automatically
     pick up the library if installed via FINK [currently only in unstable]
CS  17-Mar-04
   - Basic.pm: add (x|y|z)logvals
CED 16-Mar-04
   - IO::Pnm::Pic.pm: added wim() and rim() for more uniform RGB handling.
   - Doc::Perldl.pm: help module now gracefully handles multiple matches, 
    and also ignores SIGPIPE if you quit the pager.
   - Graphics/PGPLOT/Window/Window.pd:  added DirAxis option to initenv().
RL 16-Mar-04
   - Graphics/PLplot/plplot.pd: Defined low-level interfaces for plmesh,
     plmeshc, plot3d and plscmap1l in which the size arguments are deduced
     from the piddles.  Example x11.pl in the PLplot sources is completely
     ported to PerlDL now. 
RL 15-Mar-04
   - Graphics/PLplot/plplot.pd: Implemented the low-level PLplot API
     functions pltr0, pltr1, pltr2, and plcont.  Added some 'Doc' place
     holders in the pp_def's.
RL 13-Mar-04
   - Graphics/PLplot/plplot.pd: Define our own plstyl subroutine, where the
     first argument of c_plstyl (the length of the mark and space vectors)
     is deduced from the piddle.
RL 11-Mar-04
   - Graphics/PLplot/plplot.pd: Use the here-document operator (<<) for
     multi-line strings.  This makes the style of code more close to Doug's
     original style.
RL 8-Mar-04
   Graphics/PLplot/plplot.pd:
   - Implement the #define'd constants in plplot.h as functions in Perl,
     whose pp_def's are automatically generated by the
     create_low_level_constants function.
   - Added interface for the PLplot function plsurf3d.  This has been tested
     with the example x08.pl, recently added to the PLplot CVS sources.
RL 5-Mar-04
   - Graphics/PLplot/plplot.pd, t/plplot.t: Define our own plfill and plsym
     subroutines, where the first argument of c_plfill and c_plsym (the
     length of the data vector) is deduced from the piddle. 
RL 4-Mar-04
   - Graphics/PLplot/plplot.pd, t/plplot.t: Define our own plhist perl
     subroutine, where the first argument of c_plhist (the length of the
     data vector) is deduced from the piddle. 
CED 4-Mar-04
   Minor fixes to PDL::Transform - slightly better handling of hanning and
    gaussian cases; tweaks to documentation.
RL (for DH) 2-Mar-04
   - New version of Graphics/PLplot/Makefile.PL that allows build of PDL
     on a totally fresh system.
RL 1-Mar-04
   - Graphics/PLplot/plplot.pd, t/plplot.t: Define our own plpoin perl
     subroutine, where the first argument of c_plpoin (the length of the x
     and y vectors) is deduced from the piddle. 
CED 1-Mar-04
   Minor fixes to PDL::IO::FITS
CED 29-Feb-04
   PDL::IO::FITS
     - Some more refinements to rfits (see docs).
     - wfits now allows write of binary tables.
   primitive.pd: fix to glue() makes it properly permissive with dims.
CED 25-Feb-04
   - Further changes to PDL::IO::FITS:
    * More cleanup of header handling code
    * Split out image-reading code into its own XTENSION handler
        [part of transition to more modular FITS handling]
    * No test cases yet.
DJB 24-Feb-04
   - 'use strict' fix for PDL::IO::FITS::rfits (when reading a binary table)
     (needs test cases added to t/fits.t)
   - FITS checks moved from t/misc.t into t/fits.t (new file)
   - t/misc.t and t/fits.t now use the Test module
CED 12-Feb-04
   - FITS.pm: Applied patches 881870 and 880507 from Kaj Wiik -- zero size
     field fix, and 'A' and 'X' type fixes.
CED 5-Feb-04
   - Window.pm: fits_imag accepts CROTA if CROTA2 is not defined.
   - m51.fits: moved CRPIX1 to agree better with the galaxy center
CED 4-Feb-04
   - Frestore again returns the eval'ed value rather than TRUE
CS 28-01-04
   - win32 fixes in several testfiles
     and updated INSTALL instructions for win32
DJB 15-01-04
   - Hack to get fits_imag($img) to look like fits_imag($img,{j=>0}) when
     the RA axis is in descending order [+ internal changes to make the two
     go through the same code when setting limits].
DJB 14-01-04
   - moved FITS-header messages from IO/Misc/Makefile.PL to
     IO/FITS/Makefile.PL since rfits/wfits are no longer in IO/Misc
   - added WCS as an option to the fits_imag/fits_rgbi routines in
     PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT[::Window]. This allows you to use any alternate
     WCS mappig stored in the FITS header. Only tested using images from the
     Chandra X-ray satellite, so you can now say
       fits_imag($img,{j=>1,wcs=>'p'});
     to display the 'physical' coordinate system of the image
   - added docs for fits_cont() [essentially just copied fits_rgbi]
   - added fits_cont and fits_vect to PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT + internal updates
     to reduce replicated code.
DJB 13-01-04
   - t/dumper.t now passes on OS-X (10.3.2); needed to add '-s' option to
     uudecode call otherwise the directory name was being ignored.
CS  13-01-04
   - Basic/Makefile.PL: override MakeMaker clean to *not* delete
     files named 'core' (problem on case insensitive platforms)
DJB 12-01-04 [merge of config-variable-cleanup branch]
   - Clean up the use of config values in the build
     process. We no longer use %PDL_CONFIG but use %PDL::Config in
     Makefile.PL's and *.pm's (it unifies the code since we do not need
     to check for one or the other). The config files (e.g. perldl.conf)
     still use the PDL_CONFIG variable.
   - added a TEMPDIR config entry which defines the location of the
     temporary directory to use during the build and testing phases;
     updated code to use this where spotted (may be other locations
     lurking around, particularly in the tests)
   - Moved configuration of MALLOCDBG-related variables into the top-level
     Makefile.PL since the same bit of code was seen in several Makefile.PL's
2.4.1 released
CS  6-01-04
   - PDL.pm: version to 2.4.1
CED 12-31-03
   - Cleared out cruft from MatrixOps build process.
CED 12-29-03
   - PLPlot Makefile.PL prints more informative messages during configure
   - Added crash test to t/plplot.t
   - 'yes'/'no' -> 1/0 conversion added to bottom of perldl.conf
DJB 12-23-03
   - fix small bug in PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window::initenv() revealed
     by perl 5.8.2 and test 11 of t/pgplot.t (Use of uninitialized value...)
CS  12-19-03
   - small release notes change
   - t/primitive.t: test empty piddle handling
CED 12-16-03
   - ufunc.pd: average() returns 0 when given an integer empty piddle
    and nan when given a floating-point empty piddle (unless badvals
    are compiled, in which case you get BAD back).
   - Fixed broken vector coastline (when did that happen?)
   - Minor documentation fix to NDF.pm.PL
CS  12-16-03
   - t/plplot.t: redirect stderr to get rid of silly messages
   - update Release_Notes
CED 12-15-03
   - primitive.pd: change statsover to use population standard deviation for
     rms term -- solves bug #852359
   - transform.pd: changed call to nan("") to sqrt(-1) for cross-system 
    compatibility (Slowlaris has no nan() call)
   - Fixed typo in FITS.pm; shut up precedence complaints from t/func.t and
    slatec.t
   - Shut up v-strings warning in NiceSlice.pm
   - Numerous other warnings from perl 5.8.2 suppressed.
CS  12-12-03
   - Lvalue.pm: change v-strings to backwards compatible version numbers
CED 09-Dec-2003
   - m51.fits: Replaced non-free NOAO image with free Hubble Heritage image
CS  08-Dec-2003
   - Core.pm.PL: fix nslice to handle empty piddles
CED 07-Dec-2003
   - ufunc.pd: average() and daverage() return 0 when given an empty piddle
    in a non-bad-value environment.  [One might argue that this should be
    nan; I'm open to changing it...]
   - ufunc.pd: andover, orover, etc. no longer convert arguments to 
    integer types before performing the operation.  bandover and borover
    work as before, since bitwise and makes no sense on floating-point
    types.
CED 05-Dec-2003
   - Clean up axis labeling code in imag(); should eliminate spurious
    doubled titles.
CS  04-Dec-2003
   - add code to Makefile.PL that tries to detect
     broken redhat installations
CS  03-Dec-2003
   - PGPLOT::Graphics::Window: activate autolog for the 'points'
     command and add some brief docs about autologging (see docs
     for AXIS option)
CED 25-Nov-2003
   - Fixed eigens; eigenvectors are now in the columns of the output 
    eigenvector matrix, rather than in the rows.
CED 21-Nov-2003
   - Fixed bug 755563 (I hope) in the OpenGL configuration
   - Fixed bug 793195; some random doc improvements for  Image2D and Transform.
DH  21-Nov-2003
   - Upgraded PLplot interface for plplot-5.2.1 and perl 5.8.2.  Improved
     test suite.  Also fixed two small bugs which give warnings during
     'make test' under perl 5.8.2:  One in primitive.pd and the other in misc.pd.
CED 19-Nov-2003
   - Several minor fixes and improvements to rfits().  Notably, it now
    works in array context, pulling all extensions and returning as list.
CED 17-Nov-2003
   - Split FITS IO into its own module.
CS  13-Nov-2003
   - GSL version check (>= 1.3) in Lib/GSL/Makefile.PL
     related to bug 806229 which might be caused by a version
    mismatch(?)
CED 11-Nov-2003
   - Added FITS BINTABLE reading to PDL::IO::Misc.
CED 04-Nov-2003
   - Updated Matrix.pm 
   - Removed null tests from trans code in PP.pm - to enable better handling
    of null piddles.  (fixes bug 779312, I hope)
CED 16-Oct-2003
   - Added whatis() function to perldl
CED 15-Oct-2003
   - Added PDL::IO::IDL.
CED 15-Sep-2003

CED 23-Aug-2003
   - Added uniqvec() to primitive.pd
CED 22-Aug-2003
   - Added 'mirror' boundary condition to range()
   - Added qsortvec() to ufunc -- lexicographically sort a bunch of vectors.
CED 8-Aug-2003

    into the PDL::DiskCache class for easier access to the "sync" and
    "purge" methods.

     in "? /tmp/foo")
JC  22-Jul-2003
   - Fixed bug in polar to re-im conversion routine (Cp2r) in 
     PDL::Complex. Added test case in complex.t to check that
     re-im to polar conversion followed by polar to re-im ends
     up with the same value we started with.
CED 12-Jul-2003
   - interpND: added cubic and FFT interpolation schemes.
CED 5-Jul-2003
   - imagend.pd: convolveND is ready to roll: fixed off-by-1 errors, 
    added tests and documentation.  
CED 3-Jul-2003
   - imagend.pd: add optimized "convolveND".  Still needs a bit of offset-by-1
    work, but runs 3x faster than convolve() for direct convolution.
CED 29-Jun-2003
   - slices.pd: clump allows "-n" to mean "keep n dimensions".
CED 28-Jun-2003
   - Transform.pm: fix autoranging of map()
   - primitive.pd: fix negative-index case in linear interpolation 
    (floor is required to prevent round *up* for negative indices)
CS
   - fix NiceSlice foreach bug; v to 1.0.0
   - fix fftwconv
2.4.0 released
CED 22-May-2003
   - Better fallbacks for RGB images if PGPLOT-RGB support isn't installed
         (Window.pm)
   - pgplot.t test cleans up its own window.
CED 21-May-2003
   - Revamped tranforms demo
   - Added cartography demo
   - Fixed justification logic in Graphics::PGPLOT::Window::fits_foo
   - Fixed a bunch of documentation
   - Removed debugging prints from Cartography.pm
CED 20-May-2003
   - "arbitary" -> "arbitrary" in Window.pm
   - Fixed-up Transform demo
JC 19-May-2003
   - Updated Release Notes
CED 19-May-2003
   - Fixed FlexRaw to use binmode() on file handles.  Also fixed flexraw.t
    to use binmode() in its byte-swapper.
CS 170503
   - Makefile.PL cleanup + restrict tests when vital modules missing
CS 140503
   - further Makefile.PL fiddling
CED 12-05-2003
   - Lib/Transform now doesn't complain with -w (addressing DJB's objection)
   - wfits now corrects the size of the output header.
   - Shrunk Cartography sample data
CS 080503
   - Makefile.PL now absolutely requires Filter::Util::Call & 
     Text::Balanced for PDL::NiceSlice
DJB 060503
   - Makefile.PL now enforces Perl >= v5.6.0 (+ removal of old code)
CS 060503
   - set OPTIMIZE via perldl.conf
   - PDL.pm: version @ 2.4.0
   - Inline::Pdlpp: new NOISY flag (show compilation output)
CS 030503
   - is_inplace: allow testing and unsetting inplace flag in one statement
   - complex.pd: fiddling with namespaces and other bits
   - add 'reshape' to lvalue funcs
CS 190403
   - export pdl_changed, pdl_children_changesoon and pdl_vaffinechanged
     into PDL::Core struct (for usage in external modules)
     bumped up pdl_core_version to 5
   - use those funcs to fix inplace ffts in PFL::FFTW (fix bug #716449)
   - pdlapi.c, pdlthread.c, pdl.h.PL: changes to help debugging the
     PDL Core; all pointers are now dumped in hex in the pdl_dump_XX
     routines
   - pdlapi.c: delete one statement in pdl_changed that broke, for
    example, calling fft with certain kind of slices (see comments)
        fixes bug #716447 (but note that I wasn't sure what this statement
        was required for in the first place; so breakages in other places
        as a result are not inconceivable)
   - disabled foomethod tests (foo.t) since foomethod broke as a result of
     removing the statement in pdlapi.c (see above). I assume that the
     statement in question was only introduced to make the foomethod work
CED 15-Apr-2003
   - Cleaned up a lot of documentation
CED 14-Apr-2003
   - By request, headers are now deep-copied recursively.
   - Removed a debugging printf in PP.pm
CED 12-Apr-2003
   - Various: Modified header copying to be quasi-deep, rather than 
    by reference only.  Changes to PP.pm, Core.pm.PL, and some
    test files.
CED 9-Apr-2003
   - slice.pd : Added permissive ranging to, er, range(). Missing source dims 
    are treated as if they dummy dims of order 1.  
DJB 09-Apr-2003
   - Fixed PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window::legend to correctly handle
     synonyms (confusion between PDL::Option's synonyms()/add_synonym())
CED 8-Apr-2003
   - Minor fix to Transform::map: if you supply a destination FITS header it
    replaces the original FITS header in the remapped output.
CS  Dev.pm: apply Michael Schwern's fix for ExtUtils::LibList
    Makefile.PL, Types.pm.PL: fix race where Types.pm.PL tries to use
        PDL::Config before it is written
    discovered bug in FFTW inplace code: breaks inplace routines with
        slices; added TODO test to fftw.t
DJB 02-Apr-2003
   - moved code from Basic/Bad/bad.pd to Basic/Core/Types.pm.PL: should
     never really have been adding to the PDL::Type namespace from a
     different module! (no change to the user)
CED 30-Mar-2003
   - range now allows using the empty piddle as an index; the resulting
    range is the empty piddle.
DJB 28-Mar-2003
   - removed TYPES_LONGLONG hack from perldl.conf
CS
   - changed handling of bad values to accommodate longlong types
     general infrastructure overhaul to improve type handling
CED 27-Mar-2003
   - Added XRange,YRange keys to image handling in Graphics::PGPLOT::Window.
CED 25-Mar-2003
   - Fixed pgplot.t test to not use broken asynchronous I/O in perl5.
    Switches interactivity on an environment variable instead.
CS 25/03/03
   - karma.pd: added 'kvis' command to start new kvis app
CS 22/03/03
   - renamed det in slatec.pd to detsclatec; avoids name clash with
     PDL::MatrixOps::det; I tried to make the change backwards compatible
   - PDL::ImageND, PDL::FFT, PDL::FFTW: moved kernctr from PDL::FFT into
     PDL::ImageND so it can be used by both PDL::FFT and PDL::FFTW; both
     PDL::FFT and PDL::FFTW export it now by default
CED 20-March-2003
    - pdlhash.c: if PDL::BIGPDL is true, then ignore the 1-Gb limit on PDLs.
    - Window.pm: 
    - Fix labeling bug that affected some output devices (titles
       were doubled in ppm device due to a pgplot buffering bug).
    - Fix handling of FITS headers in _fits_foo -- let PDL dimensions
       override NAXIS<n>.
    - PP.pm:
    - hdrcpy bit is sticky, so that headers make their way down 
       pipelines of operations.  
CED 18-March-2003
    - Core.pm.PL: fix '.=' closure (closes bug #630793)
    - pdlapi.c: Check that a dimension is nonzero before dividing by it,
    in pdl_make_physvaffine.  This bug might exist elsewhere too, 
    causing random crashes with Empty and Null piddles.  But at
    least this closes bug #671891.
    - perldl.PL: Put code to execute inside a trivial block (diverts
    runaway 'last' and 'next' commands, closes bug #573841)
    - ufunc.pd: Minmax now returns (0,0) when handed the null piddle,
    unless bad values are supported in which case it returns (bad,bad).
    (closes bug #659130)
    - Window.pm: fix bug #626344 (retain old cursor position)
CS 17/03/03
    - Core.pm.PL: fix topdl method (closes bug #681015)
    - gsl_integ.pd: fix for compliance with gcc
AJ  (17-March-2003)
    - Added PDL::GSL::INTEG
CED (15-March-2003)
    - perldl: Added multi-line string processing (using Text::Balanced) 
    and EOF protection to the shell.
CED (14-March-2003)
    - Obscure bugfixes and improvements to Lib::Transform
    - t/pgplot.t Avoid a perl bug (setting an alarm from inside
    the alarm handler sometimes fails!).
    - Primitive: uniq now always returns a PDL.
AJ  (12-March-2003)
    - Minor changes to PDL::GSL::INTERP
Doug Hunt (3-Mar-2003)
    - Added PLplot interface to PDL/Graphics area.  This
      had been a separate CPAN module (PDL-Graphics-PLplot)
CED (25-Feb-2003)
    - Added 'piddle' constructor synonym :-)
CED (24-Feb-2003)
    - slices.pd:
        - range(), indexND, & interpND now accept multiple boundary conditions
    - fixed up indexNDb and indexND documentation
    - portability fix to whichdatatype_double mod
CED (21-Feb-2003)
    - Modified whichdatatype and whichdatatype_double to represent nan with
    a double, rather than barfing.
    - Myriad small fixes to Transforms::Cartography
    - Perspective works properly
    - Changes to the documentation of Window.pm: axis() is better documented.
CED (5-Feb-2003)
    - Window.pm: 
    - ctab() selects window focus now (as it should).
    - lines() doesn't barf on trivial vector
    - pgwin() is much more forgiving in its syntax.  In particular,
      you can say "pgwin(xs,J=>1)" and it'll know what you mean.
    - Basic:
    New ->fhdr method makes a tied FITS header if possible
CED (30-Jan-2003)
    - Modified interpND linear method (30% faster!).
    - Added PNG interpretation to ::IO::Pic.
    - Cleaned up RGB support in Transform/Cartography; fixed many bugs.
    in threaded transforming (mv(<n>,-1) is deprecated!)
    - Added FITS header support to transformations.
    - Added automagic RGB recognition to ->imag.
AJ  (29-Jan-2003)
    - Added PDL::GSL::INTERP and PDL::GSL::DIFF and corresponding 
    tests t/gsl_interp.t and t/gsl_diff.t
CED (28-Jan-2003)
    - Added fits_vect method to Window
    - Improved Transform demo (whizzy despiraling demo at end)
    - Fixed MANIFEST.
CED (27-Jan-2003)
    - Rearranged Lib/Transform to be more like the rest of the source tree.
    - Several bug fixes in Transform code
    - Improvements to ->map() method
    - Added truncation to ->range operator
    - Switched ->indexND to use ->range (for better data flow)
    - Added EQUIVCPTRUNC macro to PP, for permissive slicing operators 
    (like ->range) that can extend out-of-bounds.
CED (20-Jan-2003)
    - Added rgbi to Window.pm (requires newer pgplot & PGPLOT).
    - Added earth_image() to PDL::Transform::Cartography::Earth
    (this may not be the Right Way to do it)
CED (17-Jan-2003)
    - PDL::IO::Dumper uses more standard uuencode/uudecode than before,
    and uses external uuencode/uudecode by preference (faster than
    Convert::UU)
CED (16-Jan-2003)
    - Minor fixes to Transform.
    - PDL::IO::Pic is auto-used.
CED (15-Jan-2003)
    - fix to Dumper -- uses Convert::UU (instead of uudecode) if available.
    - Transform::Cartography::Earth -- update dumped info
CED (3-Jan-2003)
    - primitive: added glue() method -- arbitrary-dimension append
    - Transform: 
    - renamed Projection.pm to Cartography.pm
        - Added operator overloads to Transform.pm
    - Added "dual-method" functionality to map() and apply()
    - Reversed sense of map() and unmap() to make them more intuitive.
    - Added many map projections and helper routines to Cartography.pm
    - Added Transform::Cartography::Earth with local earth-map
       (autoloaded by "earth_coast" helper in Transform::Cartography)
    - Window: 
    - Several minor fixes to lines
CS  - NiceSlice parser updates, see Changes in NiceSlice dir
    - .cvsignore files for the dist (autogenerated so hopefully
      no screwups, please let me know if you notice any problems)
CED (19-Dec-2002)
    - window.pm: Fixed off-by-one bug in ->lines
    - Transform.pm: Fixed some stuff in t_linear
    - Added Lib/Transform/Projection.pm
CED (17-Dec-2002)
    - Minor fixes to Transform.pm
    - Added "lines" to Window.pm
    - Added Earth map data file to the top level of the distro.
    - temporarily added "earth-interp.pl" to the top level of the distro.
    - Allowed "Methods" as well as "Functions" for func list in Doc.pm
CED (11-Dec-2002)
    - Minor fix to Windows.pm in _FITS_tr.
CED (10-Dec-2002)
    - Minor fixes to Windows.pm
    - First cut at pgplot.t -- test suite for pgplot windowing stuff.
    - Fixed up some Transform documentation.
CED (09-Dec-2002)
    Fixes to Windows.pm:
    - all Pix/Scale/Pitch parsing is now in initenv() (so, e.g., 
      those options work on ->line and ->points).
    - initenv() knows about self->held for more convenient wrapping
        (and fixing of the old doesn't-switch-windows-when-held bug)
    - _fits_foo implements generic fits_<foo> processing for easier
      addition of fits stuff.
        - fits transformations are in _fits_tr
    - image range finding is in _fits_xyvals
    - justify works in a generalized way.  Justify=>1 works like you
      expect, but Justify=><r> also sets the pixel aspect ratio, 
      for more juicy flavor.
CED (06-Dec-2002)
    - Minor fix to range documentation
    - Shut up warnings in Window.pm sig handler and fix fits_imag (bug #649630)
    - Fixed bugs #633385, #634257
    - attempted to regularize justify option (in progress)
CED (05-Dec-2002)
    - Numerous fixes to PDL::Transform
    - Minor tweak to MatrixOps
    - Some cosmetic improvements to InterpND (better option control)
CED (03-Dec-2002)
    - Completely rewrote range code -- it's more elegant, faster, and
    more general now.
CED (02-Dec-2002)
    - added ndcoords (new index piddle constructor) to Basic.pm
    - indexND now uses range call instead of index call (works faster)
    - many mods to Transform
CED (21-Nov-2002)
    - PDL::Math loads PDL::MatrixOps by default for backwards compatibility.
CED (19-Nov-2002) 
    - PDL::Slices::identity -> s_identity; identity is now 
    exported from MatrixOps and constructs an identity matrix.
    - Ported MatrixOps to PP; moved to subdir of Basic; split the 
    matrix ops from math.pd and moved into matrixops.pd  MatrixOps
    is now autoloaded by "use PDL;".
    - Minor mods & cross-refs added to documentation in several modules
CED (18-Nov-2002)
    - Transform: improvements to t_lookup
CED (17-Nov-2002)
    - MatrixOps: improved inv and det can thread using lu_decomp2 
    - Transform: 
    - use svd to characterize the jacobian in integrative mapping
    - integrative ('jacobian') mapping works reasonably quickly and
      is correct.  Some changes to options.
    - Better documentation for svd in math.pd
CS  - yet another special case for NiceSlice, see NiceSlice Changes
CED (15-Nov-2002)
    - photometric distortion appears to be correct -- but hogs memory like
    crazy.  One more iteration to make it usable!
CED (14-Nov-2002)
    - interpND defaults to 'sample' if its input is an integer type
    - Math::eigens is quiet about symmetrizing unless PDL::debug is set
    - photometric distortion (not correct yet but functional) in PDL::Transform
    - updates to MatrixOps.pm   
DJB (14-Nov-2002)
    - Added 'demo transform' to perldl to showcase PDL::Transform
CED (14-Nov-2002)
    - Math::eigens is now threadable.
DJB (12-Nov-2002)
    - Added the TYPES_LONGLONG option to perldl.conf: by default it is set to 1
      which means that PDL will try and compile support for a 64 bit type. Set
      to 0 if make fails (or fix the code to work with PDL_LongLong types!)
CS  - NiceSlice doc additions
    - PDL::Core: squeeze as reshape(-1) alias
CED (11-Nov-2002)
    - Transform.pm updates - conformal radial expansion, better 
    documentation, better composition, several minor bug fixes
CS  - NiceSlice.pm v0.99: fix modifier parsing + allow several modifiers
CED (7-Nov-2002)
    - Several updates to Transform.pm -- wrap() method, rot option to Linear,
    and improved composition -- but NOT (just yet) jacobian support.
    - Updated documentation for index() method in slices.pd
    - Minor tweaks to MatrixOps.
CED (6-Nov-2002)
    - Added MatrixOps.pm version 0.5
    - Added t/matrixopt.t
CED (30-10-2002)
    - Added Transform.pm version 0.5
CED (29-10-2002)
    - m51.fits: hand-edited the file to fix bad NAXIS tag (was 0)
CED (25-10-2002)
    - IO/Misc.pm: removed not-so-spurious warnings from rfits (bug #626342)
    - PGPLOT/Window.pm: fixed spinlocks for PGPLOT -- now faster,
    clearer, and actually functional (see bug #615277). 
    - Primitive/primitive.pd: fix to interpND behavior -- it now threads 
    correctly in the bilinear dual-threading case.
    - Lib/Slatec/slatec.pd: added nonsquare-array check to matinv.
    Similar checks are probably needed throughout to keep FORTRAN
    from dying.
CS  - PDL::IO::FlexRaw now understands all types
    - uncommented type longlong -- let's see how many installations
      break ;)
    - added t/iotypes.t
CS  ******** merged in type extension stuff
    - example of extending data types: add longlong type (64bit integer)
    - that type is disabled by default but you can uncomment the
      section in Types.pm.PL to try it out
    *** no modification of IO modules yet
    *** just the core changes to add the type + other changes to
    *** make all modules compile
    *** may serve as a testbed for type extensions
    *** needs testing with BADVALUE support
CS  - preparations for type extension: concentrate all type-dependent info
      in Types.pm.PL
CS  - cpoly.c: try to fix values.h problem on BSDs etc
CS  - patch for cygwin by Christopher Marshall (Bugs item #597985)
CS  - fix box2d threading bug
CS (25/9/2002)
    - 2.3.4 release branch merged into trunk
TJ (13-Sep-02)
    - Basic/Core/Core.xs hdr and gethdr XS functions did not strictly
      adhere to XS syntax. (5.005_03 xsubpp complains loudly)
DJB/CS (11-Sep-02)
    - 'make clean' now removes _Inline/ as does t/inlinepdlpp.pl when its
      run (to make sure that we're testing the latest&greatest code)
TJ (09-Sep-02)
    - Fix valgrind warning in pdlapi.c (use of uninitialised variable in dump)
    - PDL::IO::Storable now uses PTR2IV
TJ/CS (09-Sep-02)
    - Fix memory leak associated with magic
CED (30-Aug-02)
    - Fix to Window.pm documentation -- explains wart about panel()
CED (29-Aug-02)
    - minor fix to fits_imag -- axis labels
    - Added TightLabels (boolean) and TitleSize (float) standard options
    to control window labeling. 
CED (28-Aug-02)
    - minor fix to rangeb - physicalize index before checking its size
CED (27-Aug-02)
    - range() is now an lvalue, as are indexND and indexNDb.
    - pdl_malloc call is now via PDL Core structure, avoiding
    complete failure of the test suite :-)
    - extra debugging fprintf() calls deleted.
    - range() is a front-end to rangeb(), allowing omission of optional
    arguments.
    - rangeb handles boundary conditions.
CED (26-Aug-02)
    - slices.pd: added range (PP implementation)
    - Incremented core_version in pdlcore.h.PL
    - ->range doesn't spew debugging now (commented out)
CED (20-Aug-02)
    - slices.pd: added rangeND (first-cut implementation)
---- 2.3.4 release merged into trunk on 25/9/2002 (see above)
2.3.4
JC (23 Sep 02)
    - Changes to Release_Notes associated
      with making release 2.3.4
Frederic Magnard (2002-09-20)
    - Fix NAXIS in fits writer with Astro::FITS::Header
TJ (2002-09-20) - wfits should now write SIMPLE as logical with
      Astro::FITS::Header
TJ  - wfits now works correctly with Astro::FITS::Header
TJ  - Paper over weirdness in PDL::GSL build when Slatec is disabled. 
TJ  - func.t was failing if Slatec was not available. This was because
      PDL::Func was loaded before PDL::Slatec in t/func.t. Now fixed
      (and include an additional croak in PDL::Func).
TJ  - Compatibility fixes for perl 5.005_03
        + updated ppport.h from perl 5.8.0
        + lvalue problems with slices.pd and primitive.pd
        + Graphics/PGPLOT/Window/Window.xs now uses ppport.h
TJ  - Core.xs.PL used invalid XS for hdr and gethdr
DJB - Backported "_Inline removal to Makefile.PL & t/inlinepdlpp.t"
CS  - version to 2.3.4
CS  - backported a number of patches from the main branch
      DB 9/11:  Lite.pm typo
      TJ 9/02:  PDL::IO::Storable now uses PTR2IV
            Fix valgrind warning in pdlapi.c
            (use of uninitialised variable in dump)
            Fix memory leak associated with magic
----- branched off 2.3.4 release at this point
CED (19-Aug-02)
    - Window.pm spinlock includes special release_and_barf to unlock signals.
    (the Right Answer is to fix barf() to throw a __DIE__ signal;
    but that opens other cans of worms.)
    - documentation for some of the inplace-flag handlers
CED (16-Aug-02)
    - indexND: runs faster; doesn't check boundaries at all
    - indexNDb: includes "forbid" boundary condition (which barfs on violation)
    - interpND: skips trivial cases for bilinear interpolation (factor-of-2
    speedup for each dimension that is indexed by an integer)
    - Window.pm: 
    * ->imag labels axes, if you pass in label fields as options.
        * isolated initenv() viewport setup, so imag() can use it in pix code
               
CED (15-Aug-02)
    - PGPLOT::Window fixes:
    - ticks default to outside for images; inside for everyone else
    - cleaned up pixel scaling code (used initenv() now) in imag
    - Image alignment code - you can choose how the image fits within
      the box if you explicitly set the scaling (or use fits_imag)
    - fits_imag automagically draws wedges rather than modifying the title.
    - draw_wedge position defaults to 1.5 rather than 2 (avoids cropping of
      wedge labels in the default case).
CED (12-Aug-02)
    - Minor speed increase to InterpND (still needs work!)
    - PGPLOT::Window::(imag1|imag|fits_imag) now does pixel scaling correctly
    (I hope) -- substituded pgqvp (viewport dims) for pgqvsz (window dims)
    - Axes now default to having tick marks outside the box instead of inside 
    the box.  That prevents scrozzling by images.
    - pgwin() convenience function is a little more convenient
    - Fix to spinlocks in Window.pm.
    - gethdr() can return undef again; new method hdr() is always defined.
CED (9-Aug-02)
    - Signal-deferral mechanism for PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window should
    avoid many pgplot-related weirdnesses
CED (8-Aug-02)
    - Minor fixes to fits_imag, also in PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window
    - Minor fix to IndexND, in slice.pd
    - now fits_imag doesn't attempt to reconcile different CTYPE units.
DJB (8-Aug-02)
    - changed behaviour of TextWidth option in PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window
      It is now only applied if specified (ie doesn't default to 1 and so
      clobber the LineWidth/HardLW settings). Added a little documentation
      but it needs to be improved.
CED (7-Aug-02)
    - Slightly cleaner MOD in ops.pd
    - added interpND (to primitive.pd) and indexNDb (to slices.pd).
CED (6-Aug-02)
    - New % operator follows (mathematically correct) perl % operator behavior
    - AutoLoad throws an error if foo.pdl doesn't declare foo().  (used
    to loop endlessly).  
    - AutoLoad error messages are more informative.
CS  - hopefully fixed bug with new pdl(arrayref) implementation
CED (2-Aug-02)
    - Add IndexND to slices.pd
    - Add pdl output for scalar context to WhereND in primitive.pd
CED (1-Aug-02)

      to recognize drop-in replacement functions for rpic/wpic)
    - Minor fix to FITS I/O version checking
CS  - add PDL::IO::Storable and PDL::GSL::SF hierarchy

CS  - explicitly load PDL::Core in PP boot section
    - examples: make modules with Inline::Pdlpp! 
CED (26-Jun-02)
    PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window::line() autoranging avoids infinity
CED (25-Jun-02)
    Changes to PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window:
    - Added pgwin() -- exported constructor (less typing)
    - Added =>Size option to constructor    (less typing)
    - Added =>Units option to constructor (PGPLOT units only at the moment)
    - Interactive windows appear at the size you ask for. (less annoyance)

      problem seen with using 'use strict' with perl 5.6.0
CS  - patch by Ken Williams to improve speed of 'pdl $perl_array_ref'
CS  - check for Astro::FITS::Version >= 1.12
CED (17-Jun-02)
    - add fits_imag to PGPLOT interface
CS  - allow niceslice to use the syntax
          $pdl($greater_1D_piddle)
        which indexes into flattened $pdl; result has same shape
        as $greater_1D_piddle
CS  - allow PP Code to handle constructs like
            $arr(n => 3*i+1)
        if Text::Balanced is installed
    - fix included Benchmark suite
    - NiceSlice.pm: make splitprotected interface similar to split's
CS  - fix PP.pm: bug #564937 (needed a check for sv_isobject(...) )
    - make sure pp_done is called automatically if user forgets!
CS  - applied Diab's patch #559860: improve trylink, Math/Makefile.PL
    - applied Diab's patch #559885: overload 'eq'
    - Inline::Pdlpp: fix join-bug, add MakePdlppInstallable to allow
      installation of modules with Inline Pdlpp calls, update test
      and INFO method
    - allow to set trylink 'Hide' behaviour from perldl.conf (suggested
      by Diab)
DJB (04 Jun 02)
    - minor fixes to the build highlighted by warnings from perl 5.8.0
TJ (31 May 02)
    - Use INT2PTR/PTR2IV to fix compiler warnings
      when the IV size does not match the pointer size
      (eg linux with -Dusermorebits). This will break compatibility
      with perl 5.005 unless we add some of our own macros
    - Fix prototype warning in rout.pd with PerlIO_print
    - Apply CS's patch to CallExt.pm to prevent spurious
      failure of DynaLoader in perl 5.8.0
2.3.3
JC (22 May 02)
    - Changes to Release_Notes, PDL.pm associated
      with making release 2.3.3
CS  - bump up NiceSlice version
    - gsl_random rng destructor!
    - improve PDL::Exporter doc (I never remember the darn syntax)
CS  - reshape behaviour like idl when no dim args are given
    - niceslicing gets a new modifier: $a(;-) drops dims of size 1
CED (16 May 02)
    - Several minor changes to Dumper and RandVar for compatibility with
    BSD and perl 5.005
CS  - Makefile.PL: warning if mods for NiceSlice missing
    - IO/Misc: print warning at the end of the make output
    - Graphics/PGPLOT: small change to the (still undocumented) autolog func
CED (15 May 02)
    - Added Astro::FITS::Header recognition to PDL::IO::Dumper.
CED (14 May 02)
    - Removed NiceSlicing from RandVar and Dumper (they use slice only now)
CED (from the distant past)
    - Added PDL::IO::Dumper, which provides deep data structure storage
    and retrieval in armored-ASCII format.  Requires Data::Dumper 
    (from CPAN), FITSIO (also from CPAN), and uuencode(1). 
CED (13 May 02)
    - Modified legacy rfits/wfits support to handle strings more cleanly
    (more like Astro::FITS::Header)
    - Moved missing-module message to IO/Misc/Makefile.PL
    - Added stringification test to t/misc.t
CED (10 May 02)
    - Modified rfits/wfits to support Astro::FITS::Header as an underlying
    FITS header driver. The fallback (to the more-or-less original KGB 
    code) is probably Wrong as string handling now changes depending
    on the presence of Astro::FITS::Header;
    whether Astro::FITS::Header is present; but ultimately everyone
    just uses Astro::FITS::Header and the problem goes away.
CS  - folded PDL-2_3-gimp-fix branch into main trunk
    - typos

    - Core: remove pdlfamily.c dependencies and delete the file
            pdlapi.c: make_now noop, future_me etc stuff in pdl_destroy
    - PP: make_now is really a noop with above family changes - removed
    - doc updates
DJB (09 Apr 02)
    - added 'use PDL::Math' to PDL.pm (but not Lite/LiteF versions)
    (22 Apr 02)
    - added Kaj Wiik's patch to use pgtbox in PGPLOT/Window.pm (#538831)
      -- this needs documentation!
JB  (07 Apr 02)
    - Moved $CTAB to become part of the $self object in PGPLOT/Window.pm 
      This fixes the error that caused the second image plotted to hard-
      copy devices to become blank.
DJB (02 Apr 02)

      with making release 2.3.1
DJB - added WITH_IO_BROWSER to perldl.conf (default 0) to
      control whether PDL::IO::Browser is made. Will now compile
      on MacOS X 10.1.
CS  - get rid of Perl_die etc dependencies and other barfisms
    - make sure t/inlinepdlpp.t has a full search path to PDL::Core
    - Basic/Pod : podselect only when Pod::Select available
CS  - fix Makefile/Dev.pm bugs (that break build on PDL-free
      systems)
    - bump version to 2.3.1
2.3

DJB (23/Oct/01)
    - changes to bad.pd in order to clean up build slightly (for 
      instance we longer need to create pdlapi.c from pdlapi.c.PL)
    - added Diab Jerius' patch [ #469110 ] for rvals/options
    - added a test for this [and fixed a bug I'd introduced]
DJB (15/Oct/01)
    - minor fix to ellipse (no longer requires options array) and to
      imag (will correctly handle transforms for axes with "-ve" pixel 
      size, such as RA in Astronomy)
CS  - Xrange, Yrange for PGPLOT, fix tline and tpoints
CS  - niceslice docs, class methods for PDL::Options,
      perldl: enable niceslicing at startup (if available)
      Lvalue: add sever method
CS  - Inline::Pdlpp docs addittions, test script added
CS  - NiceSlice modifiers + bug fix

JB  - Added a recording feature to the PGPLOT interface.
CS  - NiceSlice doc update
JB  (14/Aug/01)

      **** required renaming 'new' member of struct Core to 'pdlnew' !! **** 
CS  - Makefile.PL: Filter::Simple, Text::Balanced dependencies
    - bad.pd: fix for win32
    - Lib/Slatec/Makefile.PL: win32 fix
    - t/flexraw.t: remove extraneous 'use ExtUtils::F77'

    - win32: general update for latest build; add slatec support
DJB (20/Jun/01)
    - make bad.pd compile with PDL::Type changes and fix minor bug
CS  - fix rvals bug (annoying one!)
    - syntactical sugar: convenience operators for PDL::Type
CS  - Basic/SourceFilter (see also L<PDL::SFilter>)
    - generate PP templates with pptemplate
    - PP: pp_boundscheck (see PP.pm)
CS  - PP.pm: remove first '$this' arg from pp_add_exported!
    - LM.pm: fix implementation bug; still not sure if it works properly
             need more tests!
    - apply Raul's debian patch

      axis). Added bad-value support to centroid2d and max2d_ind
DJB (8/May/01)
    - OpenBSD doesn't seem to have values.h, which causes Basic/Math to fail:
      see http://testers.cpan.org/search?request=dist&dist=PDL#2.2.1 
      Now using limits.h in Basic/Math/mconf.h for GNU systems - only tested
      on solaris and i386-linux.
    - fixed typo in debian/rules
John Cerney (5/3/01)
    - Simple change to primitive.pd so that interpol sub
      makes it into the PDL namespace, and not just the
      PDL::Primitive namespace. Also added a simple test
      case for this routine.
CS  - F77CONF variable for debian build (see INSTALL)
2.2.1
John Cerney (4/25/01)
    - Changes to Release_Notes, PDL.pm, TODO associated
      with making release 2.2.1
CS  - PDL::Lvalue -- PDL lvalue subs (added to loaders)
    - PDL::Matrix -- added docs
    - doc tidbits
    - don't test raster and SGI formats any more (pic(no)*rgb.t)
John Cerney (4/11/01)
    - Modified t/opengl.t to turn-off the PERL_DL_NONLAZY env variable
      when running this test. Due to some inconsistencies in the opengl
      headers (gl.h, glu.h) and what functions are actually in the opengl
      libs, PDL's OpenGL.so sometimes (When using Mesa 3.3 for instance)
      gets built with interfaces to functions that aren't there. Setting
      PDL_DL_NONLAZY=0 prevents the test case from failing in these
      cases.
DJB (10/Apr/01)
    - hacked Core/Dev.pm to work with perl 5.6.1 (ExtUtils::Liblist has
      changed although its documentation has not)
CS  - applied Christopher Marshall's minimum_n_ind patch (bug #413184) + test
CS  - fix mem leak patch so that core struct version croaking works
    * NOTE: recent patches will require recompilation of any external
    *       modules that use PDL::PP; PDL will tell you when using such
    *       modules *
    - barf is now really only an alias for croak; this is a test if we
      can live with the original croak; we should be able to!
    - update COPYING for the 21st century ;)
John Cerney (4/3/01)
    - Modified Makefile.PL in Graphics to add '-lm' to the libs.
      This fixes a 'Can't locate auto/PDL/Graphics/OpenGL/glpcOpenWin.al'
      error in make test during opengl.t for some platforms.
      Shouldn't hurt otherwise.
CS
    - make_physvaffine is now a member of the core struct
    - pdl_get is now vaffine aware (must be preceded by call to make_physvaffine)
    - worke around bug in the core logic (pdl_make_physical et al.) that
      cause index and others to leak memory; not the perfect solution yet
      but core logic is just way too confusing to make sense of it!!!!!!
      for details see comments in pdl_make_physical (pdlapi.c.PL) and
      pdl_initthreadstruct (pdlthread.c)
    - slatec: document the 'det' function
DJB (26/Mar/01)
    - PDL::Func now sets bc => 'simple' as the default for Hermite
      interpolation.
DJB (14/Mar/01)
    - PGPLOT::Window changes: addressed "undefined window size" part
      of bug #406858; added PosReference option + minor bug fix
      to transform()
    - renamed PosReference to RefPos. close() will print a message if
      a hardcopy device and $PDL::verbose is set, hack to fix bug 
      #408589 (draw_wedge() erasing plot) for simple cases (15/Mar/01)
DJB (27/Feb/01)
    - addressed PDL::Func bugs/doc issues as reported by 
      HalldBBBBBBBBsr Olafsson and Vince McIntyre (bug #233484)
CS  - fix bug in pow in math.pd (reported on perldl mailing list)
CS  - fixed bug in writing pnms (bug #127696)
    - Core.pm: temporary fix to work around core bug (see comments
      in pdl_make_physical in pdlapi.c) that made convert
      leak memory (related to bug #116501)
CS  - fixed diagonal bug that caused apparently random errors
      (bug #116502)
CS
    - changes for win32 compatibility:
        pdlcore.c: avoid die_where & co, use Perl_croak instead
        Math/cpoly.c: win32 doesn't know about values.h
        Lib/Image2D/resample.h: win32 doesn't know about M_PI
        t/fastraw.t: skip mmap tests on win32
    - slices.pd: possible rotate segfault fixed
    - fix slight mslice problem (didn't make sure its inputs were
      converted to int)
    - new functions 'in' and 'uniq' in primitive.pd -> need tests
    - image2d: a slightly faster median: med2df
    - new function approx in Core.pm
        **** attention: possible name clash; test scripts should *****
        **** use tapprox from now on                             *****
2.2
John Cerney (20/12/00)
    - Minor changes to Makefile.PL and Reduce.pm for compatibility with
      perl 5.005
John Cerney (6/12/00)
    - Added new curve fitting routine: Linfit. Finds
      a linear-combination of specified functions
      that best fits data. (Similar to Polynomial.pm)
Marc Lehmann (5/!2/00)
    - Don't add artificial newlines in PdlParObj.pm, you never know what the
      surrounding code might look like. Makes PDL compile with perl-5.7 again.
John Cerney (5/12/00)
    - Updated log10 in ops.pd to have consistent
      copy behavior for subclassed objects as discussed
      in Objects.pod.
    - Expanded the tests in t/subclass4.t to test for log10
      and other simple functions.
      
CS  - added some features to dice
Doug Burke 
    - rcols(): do not read an extra line with LINES option (Frank Samuelson)
    - added draw_wedge() (& DrawWedge option to imag()) to PGPLOT 
CS  -  fix call of Perl_croak in pdlthread.c for threading perls (reported
       by Diab Jerius)
Doug Burke (03/11/00)
    - removed $_ from shorttype method: fixes $_->info() bug 
    - perldl/pdldoc now list other matches to a help query (not wonderful)
    - fixed 0.5 pixel shift in imag()
CS  -  fix bug in splitdim (didn't check nthdim) that can lead to coredumps
    -  Dev.pm: malloc debugging support
    -  Core.pm.PL: flat as clump(-1) alias
           bug in mslice: cast indices to int added
Jarle Brinchmann (22/10/00)
    - Further bug fixes to PGPLOT added (courtesy of Kaj Wiik). Also a
      convenience function to calculate transforms (transform, courtesy
      of Kaj Wiik).
    - Examples/tests for the PGPLOT interface added in Example/PGPLOT
Jarle Brinchmann (21/10/00)
    - Considerable re-write of PGPLOT. This now uses PDL::Option to 
      set options. There is also now a OO interface 
      PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window which PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT now uses.
   
    - New functionality includes:

      - Interactive cursors (cursor)
      - Text on plots       (text)
      - Legends             (legend)
      - Circles, Rectangles, Ellipses
      - Multiple plot windows, oone can jump from panel to panel when
        the window is divided in several.
      - More control over options - see PDL::Graphics::PGPLOTOptions for
        details.
    This is not tested under Windows - and possibly not all functions work
    as they used to..
Doug Burke (18/10/00)
    - added warp2d (+ supporting fns) to PDL::Image2D. This allows
      images to be resampled using 2D polynomials as basis functions.
    - (19/10/00) bug fixes & clean up of documentation for above
    - rfits() now sets hdrcpy flag of piddle (so that the FITS header is 
      copied to new piddles).
Doug Burke
    - moved PDL::Type object from PDL::Core to PDL::Types. This shouldn't
      affect most people.
CS
    - split primitive.pd into primitive.pd and ufunc stuff (ufunc.pd)
    - changed loaders to reflect this split (PDL.pm, Lite.pm, LiteF.pm)
    - moved 'assgn' to PDL::Ops (since it's primarily used for
      overloading '.=')
    - added conv1d to primitive.pd -> this one was dropped
      from the dist at some stage but it makes sense to have it
    - Pic.pm: print conversion message only when debugging
    - fixed a problem with TriD: APIENTRY not defined when
            processing glu.h (since include files are ignored)
    - added sever docs
    - a reduce function for PDL (Reduce.pm)
    - percentile projections patch applied to primitive.pd
    - fix some thread_define problems
Doug Burke
    - improved support for bad values in r/wfits and r/wndf
    - added setbadtonan() to PDL::Bad.
    - moved log10() entirely over to Basic/Ops/ops.pd (so it's no longer
      defined in PDL::Core. 
CS
    - moved trylink to Dev.pm (L<PDL::Core::Dev>)
    - modified Graphics/Makefile.PL accordingly
Doug Burke
    - cleaned up endian support. Threw out my check_endian stuff since perl
      already knows - there's a isbigendian fn in Dev.pm (eg see 
      IO/Misc/misc.pd)
    - added setvaltobad() and setnantobad() to PDL::Bad, renamed replacebad()
      to setbadtoval() (perhaps should keep it as an alias?)
      setnantobad doesn't work (yet) if $PDL::Bad::UseNaN == 1
CS
    - added Matrix.pm (suggestion by Stephan Heuel)
    - Core.xs.PL: getdim, at and set now support the 'infinite dim'
      piddle behaviour discussed on pdl-porters
    - perldl: $bflag incorrect due to low 'and' precendence
    - PDL.pm: the version was still far behind ;-(
    - Basic.pm: PDL->null breaks inheritance
    - Core.pm.PL: allow <2D piddles as arguments in creating functions
        (not yet reflected in the docs). Another step on the way
        to improve the balancing act between scalar and 1D piddles
        and normal perl scalars
    - Core.xs.PL, pdlcore.h.PL: PDL.malloc -> PDL.smalloc renamed
    - Core/Makefile.PL: endian stuff only when WITH_BADVAL (reduce
      likelihood of build problems); don't assume that '.' is in the
      PATH (good distributions like DEBIAN avoid that ;)
    - Doc/Perldl.pm: new (undocumented) aproposover function -- do
        your own thing with returned matches
    - karma.pd: PDL->malloc -> PDL->smalloc

Doug Burke (09/06/00-09/07/00)
    - Core and pdl_trans structure are now the same, whatever the choice of 
      WITH_BADVAL and BADVAL_USENAN. The version number of the core has been
      bumped to 2 (removing the need for Christian's recent patch) since this
      is binary incompatible with PDL 2.1.1
    - clean up of build process - both because of above change and also to
      stop problems when switching between WITH_BADVAL = 1 and 0.
    - exported several routines in PDL::Bad
Jim Edwards
    - improved OpenGL detection during 'perl Makefile.PL'
Doug Burke (09/05/00)
    - minor clean-up to the build process. Now creates Basic/Core/badsupport.p
      in top-level Makefile.PL for when PDL::Config hasn't been created - fixes
      setting BADVAL options in ~/perldl.conf
Doug Burke 
    - Bad value support integrated into the main branch. Set WITH_BADVAL to 1 in
      perldl.conf to use. See Basic/BadValues.pod for more information and try
      the two demos (demo bad, bad2).
      Many of the internals have been tweaked (eg many more files are created at
      compile time in Basic/Core - including Dev.pm; m51.fits is now installed 
      for the bad2 demo ...)
    - Basic/Core now contains isbigendian.p - this is created at compile time.
      IO::Misc::isbigendian uses this.
    - IO::NDF now saves byte piddles as "_UBYTE", rather than "_BYTE", NDFs
    - log10 is now in Ops (using C-library version), although a version is
      left in Core.pm.PL so that log10(2.3) returns a perl scalar, not a 0D piddle
    - removed 1-argument form of where() since been deprecated long enough
Jim Edwards
    - swcols added to IO::Misc - like wcols but to a string, not a file
Jim Edwards (08/25/00)
    - minor bugfix in TriD contour3d
    - added Labels to TriD contour3d options
Doug Burke (08/12/00-08/13/00; 08/17/00)
    - minor bugfix to Graphics/Karma/Makefile.PL
    - made qsort and qsort_ind C routines in primitive.pd available to all
      modules via the PDL Core structure (pdlcore.h is now created by pdlcore.h.PL)
      and updated image2d.pd to use this (+ bug fix to patch2d)
    - added double precision versions of sum, sumover, cumusumover (same for prod)
      and average (eg dsum, daverage). Added prodover routine
      Changed stats to use this (+ changed PDL::Tests to avoid name clashes)
    - revamped Types.pm.PL
    - made Inplace option for pp_def a bit more sensible
    - marked several functions in math.pd as inplace (needs documenting)
    - fixed rndf() so that can use rndf('../bob')
Jim Edwards (08/08/00)
    - Major changes to the TriD code (requires perl 5.6.0)                      
Doug Burke (08/02/00)
    - 'bool' to 'boolvar' in cpoly.c to get it to compile under Linux
    - added 'Inplace' rule to PP.pm to flag a routine as inplace (see ops.pd)
    - minor improvement to PP output if $::PP_VERBOSE is set
CS      - ops.pd: fix inplace problem (reported by Tim Conrow)
Doug Burke (07/27/00)
    - some minor changes to PP.pm & PDLCode.pm (no longer generates
      'THISISxxx' macros in xs code unless they're required.
CS  - PP: don't use copy method when HASP2Child
    - Makefile.PL: no .3 manpages                                           
CS  - Core: pdl.h dependencies
    - pdlapi.c: comments and debugging
    - ops.pd: docs fixes
    - PGPLtw.pd: doc fOT_demo: choose /GW on MSwin32
    - mkpdlfuncpod: some experimentation
    - Karma/Makefile.PL: malloc debugging support
    - CallExt/Makefile.PL: malloc debugging support
    - fftw.pd: doc fixes, exports and convolution
    - slatec: error handler now calls croak (instead of being fatal)
        - VRML: fix problem with prototype registration
Doug Burke (7/02/00 - 7/9/00)
    - stopped some excess code generation & improve legibility of some code
      in Basic/Gen/PP.pm and Basic/Gen/PP/PdlParObj.pm
    - minor doc cleanup in Graphics/TriD/Rout/rout.pd (lack of head3 in pod)
    - added a test to t/hdrs.t to pick up a bug I'd introduced
    - replaced Basic/Core/mkpdlconv.p by Basic/Core/pdlconv.c.PL, removed
      mention of pdlbasicops in Basic/Core/Makefile.PL
Tim Jenness (6/30/00)
    - PDL::CallExt now works on WinNT with VC++
Doug Burke (6/29/00)
    - added methods to PDL::Type - enum, symbol, ctype, ppsym, realctype
      and shortctype - which provide access to information in PDL::Types 
      eg print byte->ctype prints "PDL_Byte". 
      Changed info in Core and rcols in IO/Misc to use these methods.
      Currently un-documented.
Tim Jenness (6/28/00)
    - miscellaneous patches for Win32 support
         Make Callext.pm and callext.t more generic
         Lib/Image2D check for presence of rint()
         Add ABSTRACT and AUTHOR to top level Makefile.PL
    - conv.t now uses the Test module
Doug Burke (6/21/00; 6/22/00)
    - mkhtmldoc.pl should now handle links to scripts in Index.pod for 
      perl < 5.6.0. Removed link hacking for perl >= 5.6.0.
2.1.1
CS  - fix Perl_croak problem with 'usethreading'
Doug Burke (6/15/00)
    - hand-rolled podselect (podsel) created if perl version earlier than
      5.6.0
Doug Burke (6/9/00)
    - added Christian's changes to online documentation to support scripts
      (eg see Index.pod or Index.html)
Jim Edwards (5/19/2000) TriD (cvs brance trid_experimental) (merged 6/7/00)
        - several changes in TriD including a new Tk widget, 
          see the file PDL/Graphics/TriD/README  
        - added TkTriD demo to perldl.PL
2.1
Marc Lehmann (6/7/00)
    - enable sincos optimization only for glibc >= 2.1
CS  - warn if 5.004 that next version will require 5.005
    - PL_na issue in PGPLOT.xs
    - disable sincos optimization in complex.pd until glibc issues sorted
John Cerney (6/2/00)
    - Updated FAQ to match the Jarle's version at
      http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~jarle/PDLfaq/pdlfaq_new.html
Doug Burke (5/31/00)
    - more minor doc patches
John Cerney (5/26/00)
    - Applied patch to fix reflect options in conv2d (image2D
      function) not being symmetric. Ref sourceforge Patches 100287,
      100359, and Bug 104614.
Doug Burke (5/25/00)
    - added 'pdldoc' shell command to provide access to PDL documentation
      without having to start up perldl
    - cosmetic changes to output of usage + minor doc change to PDL::Basic
John Cerney (5/25/00)
    - Modified PP.pm to call $arg1->copy for subclassed
      objects in some simple cases, otherwise call
      $class->initialize. See Basic/Pod/Objects.pod
      for a detailed discussion.
Doug Burke (5/23/00,5/24/00)
    - corrected faulty t/interp.t and t/interp_slatec.t scripts
    - minor doc changes to Indexing.pod, image2d.pd, fft.pd & NDF.pm
    - added FRAME option to iis (Graphics::IIS)
CS      - hopefully the PDL::Filter modules will work now
                a proper test should be added
Doug Burke (5/22/00)
    - Graphics::IIS - now works with new PP code + minor doc changes
    - Func - changed gradient() to work as described + added PDL::Func::
      to method names in the documentation so they do not get picked up
      by perldl's help (eg 'help set')
    - \s to \\s in getfuncdocs() to avoid warning in Doc/Doc.pm
John Cerney (5/21/00)
    - Minor Changes to Basic/Gen/PP.pm to fix error reporting, and
      to get rid of some warning messages when run with the -w 
      switch
Doug Burke (5/19/00)
        - Amalgated Interpolate & Interpolate::Slatec into PDL::Func (found
          in Lib/). I've left the old files in the distribution, although they're
          no longer made/installed, in case anyone wants to do a better job.
        - minor doc changes to Image2D
zowie   - Changed PGPLOT::im to PGPLOT::imag1 (1:1 aspect ratio shortcut).
      Avoids conflict with the imaginary-component sub by the same name.

CS  - fix for sever mem-leak -> ultimate source seems to be
        a problem in destroytransform on un-physvaffined
        piddle -- needs proper tracking down!!!!
    - more types for Otherpars (PP.pm)
Doug Burke
        - added PDL::Interpolate and PDL::Interpolate::Slatec which provide
          a (hopefully) simple, OO interface to interpolation methods
CS  - correct PDL::Ops docs
    - fix problem in pdl_croak_param (pdlthread.c) due to changes
        in Perl_mess in perl 5.6
    - update TODO
zowie   - Autoloader update (handles '+' for entire dir trees)
    - Graphics::PGPLOT::imag update (includes options for image scaling)
    - perldl update (minor fix to avoid null code ref bug in PDL::myeval)

CS  - debian stuff
    - image rotation (rot2d)
    - karma  kimagergb renamed to krgb
        krgb -> can send 3d RGB piddles now (i.e. [3,x,y,z] piddles)
CS  - quick (and semi-dirty) inplace fix for ops.pd
    - slices.pd: fix xchg,mv not catching negative dims,
            treat neg dim indices like neg perl array indices
Doug Burke (4/29/00)
        - fixed interpol failing to recognise extrapolation at 'high' x +
          added interpolate with slightly different error handling
        - commented out 'use PDL::Lib::LLSQRout' in PDL/Lib/Gaussian.pm
Tim Jenness (4/26/00)
        - Patch mconf.h so that it works on Alphas running Linux
Doug Burke
        - fixed apropos command to work with perl 5.6.0
        - t/poly.t failed on solaris 2.7 with new PP code. Changed check
          from < 200 to < 210.
        - added PDL:getdim to Core.pm documentation
Doug Hunt (4/26/2000)
        - Merged fast-xswrapper branch back to main PDL tree.
        - Left Ops thus:
          All ops are are overloaded to call XS as directly as possible, but
          the direct call of ops such as : $a->plus($b, 0) requires the '0' argument
          which tells the XS routine 'plus' not to swap the arguments.
CS
    - slight ops.pd changes
    - match prototypes with original ones in complex.pd
    - some more work on PP.pm (yet unfinished)
Doug Hunt (4/19/2000)
        - Cleaned up Ops to take advantage of new fast XS wrappers 

Doug Burke
        - changes to pod to HTML conversion. Links between modules - eg 
          L<PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT|PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT> - should now work.
          See Doc/mkhtmldoc.pl and Doc/scantree.pl
        - minor doc changes to a number of files
        - Improved output from apropos (aka ??) in the perldl shell:
          1) ref string is now cleaned of any pod directives (eg C<$a> -> '$a')
          2) the formatting has been improved, so that it fills the screen,
             word-wraps, and indents the ref string if printed on new lines
          3) better handling of long names 
          As an example, try 'perldl> ?? str' before and after.
          However, it's a *horrible* hack - using undocumented parts of
          Pod::Text to do 1 and 2, and calculation of screen width is poor.
          Needs testing on perl 5.6.0 for a start!
CS
    - applied vaffine leak fix to main branch
    - new polyfill function (image2d.pd)
    - some (unfinished) preparations for easier leak debugging, see perldl.conf
Doug Burke
        - Added PCHIP routines tp PDL::Slatec (interpolation,
          differentiation, and integration of functions).
          Also moved creation of SlatecProtos.h from Makefile.PL
          to slatec.pd
        - stop wfits() from complaining when reading in the header
          of FITS files from the DSS server at STScI
        - minor clean up of write_dummy_make() Basic/Core/Dev.pm
        - minor doc updates for PDL::Primitive and PDL::Basic
        - converted FFTW and GSL to use write_dummy_make() in Makefile.PL
Tim Jenness
    - Update PDL::IO::NDF to v1.02, enhance reading of axis errors
      plus some bug fixes.
    - Add test for PDL::IO::NDF
        - Added polynomial fitting routines to PDL::Slatec (polfit, 
      pvalue and pcoef)

John Cerney
    - Added (psuedo)-support for variable-size strings in PDL::Char

2.005
CS  - version to 2.005
    - finally try to fix 5.6.0 problem correctly
Doug Burke (4/4/00)
        - Changed to Basic/Makefile.PL to install man pages for PDL,
          PDL::Lite, PDL::LiteF, and PDL::Options.
        - Changed Makefile.PL to allow installation of documentation if
          INSTALLDIRS=perl (rather than site) is used
CS  - applied Karl's 5.6 patch to pdlcore.c
    - typo in Doug's error message fixed
Doug Hunt (3/23/00)
        - Improved error messages in PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT for the case when the
          correct version of PGPLOT (v2.16 or later) is not installed.


2.004
John Cerney (3/16/00)
    - Added -lm to the Lib/Image2D/Makefile.PL suggested by Doug Burke
      to fix a compile problem on Solaris 2.7.
John Cerney (3/15/00)
    - Added Christian Pellegrin's bilinear and image scaling patch.
          with cleaned up docs and test cases.
    - Update Version to 2.004
Doug Hunt (3/8/00)
        - Added 'use PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT' to Demos/PGPLOT_demo.pm.  Now it works.
          This bug was introduced in my 3/2 and 3/3/00 changes.

John Cerney (3/5/00)
    - Modified Basic/Complex/Complex.pd to not generate warning messages
          when re-defining the PDL overloaded operator subs.
Doug Burke
        - IO::Misc - default type for DEFTYPE (rcols option) is now definable 
          using the $PDL::IO::Misc::deftype variable.

Doug Hunt (3/3/00)
        - Removed PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT from PDL.pm.  This had been causing
          troubles due to the previous change which took away autoloading
          in PGPLOT.  

Doug Hunt (3/2/00)
        - Updated Graphics/IO/PGPLOT, adding a typemap and a PGPLOT.xs file.
          This change added capability to PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::line, allowing
          one to use the 'MISSING' option.  When this option is specified, 'line'
          will draw many disconnected polylines (delimited by the value specified
          as 'MISSING') instead of just one.  This is useful in drawing maps with
          line.

Marc Lehmann
    - Patch to Basic/Core/Dev.pm fix Parallel build bug. (Ref PDL-Porters Messages
      dated 1/8/00 and 1/5/00.)
        - Small Patch to Graphics/Karma/karma.pd. Change 'na' to 'PL_na';
          (PDL-P msg 1/15/00)

Robin Williams:
    - Patch to Graphics/TriD/OpenGL/generate.p to get 
          OpenGL working on OSF (it crunched because
          perlxs interprets the #ifs as comments 
          if they're indented).

Karl Glazebrook:
    - Patch to Perldl.PL to improve readlines handling:
       - tells you which module it is using
           - correctly informs whether editing is available or not

John Cerney
    - Documentation fix for FlexRaw.pm (Based on change submitted
          by Francois Primeau.)
    - Updated Makefile in FFTW to correct a build problem that occurs
      when both single and double FFTW libs are present. (suggested
      by Diab Jurius).
    - Updated TriD Makefile to find openGL libs specified in the 
      perldl.conf file.
    - Updated Graphics/TriD/OpenGL/generate.p to include patch by
      Diab Jerius (ref PDL-Porters message dated 11/9/99). 
      This fixes compilation problems with native openGL on solaris.
      Note: Patch to Graphics/TriD/TriD/GL.pm was not applied. (Risk
      of breaking GL on other platforms)

CS
    - added function 'det' to PDL::Slatec -> calculate determinant

Doug Burke
        - Graphics::LUT - added several intensity ramps, instead of just
          using a linear scale.
        - internal changes to Graphics::LUT - now stores data in external
          FITS files rather than within the module to improve speed and 
          reduce use of disk-space. 
        - first attempt at improving installation of OpenGL stuff
        - Graphics/IIS/iis.pd: minor change (re Christian's PP changes)
        - Graphics/PGPLOT/PGPLOT.pm: add CENTRE option [bin()], doc update
        - minor code cleanup for IO/NDF/NDF.pm and IO/Misc/misc.pd
        - added docs for sethdr to Basic/Core/Core.pm

Marc Lehmann
    - small changes to complex.pd: remove bogus Cneg, streamline docs.

Doug Burke
        - added TYPES/DEFTYPE options to PDL::IO::Misc::rcols()
          to specify the type of the piddles
          NOTE: (!!!)
            different from patch to 2.003 sent to perldl list 
            (http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perldl/2000-01/msg00037.html),
            as you now specify the types directly, rather than as strings.
        - added HEADER option to PDL::IO::Misc::wcols()
        - added BORDER option to PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT
        - added examples of new PGPLOT options to 'demo pgplot'
        - added t/lut.t to test PDL::Graphics::LUT, and
          added tests of options in rcols() to t/misc.t
        - minor doc update for PDL::Primitive - example for whichND()
          now works

CS
    - introduced switch for automatic hdr copying, off by default
    - PP: added pp_addbegin, pp_beginwrap and pp_setversion
        pp_addxs now adds to the current module's namespace by default,
        !not! to PDL anymore (patch by Marc Lehmann)
        pp_addisa now really works as advertised (i.e. adds to
        @ISA and doesn't split on whitespace anymore)
    - misc.pd: bswap functions work always inplace, remove
      [o] from sigs
    - added PDL::Complex to the dist (first try of a derived class),
      does remarkly many things already but needs some testing,
      donated by Marc Lehmann

Doug Hunt
        - added PDL::Char, a subtype of PDL which allows manipulation
          of byte type PDLs as N dimensional arrays of fixed length
          strings

Doug Burke
        - added AXIS option to PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT + doc changes
        - added PDL::LUT module to provide colour tables - useful for
          PGPLOT's ctab() function (note: plan, in near future, to
          change to a binary format to reduce size of this module)

CS
    - Levenberg-Marquardt fitting module
    - added required additional slatec functions + some docs
    - some handy bits for PDL::Options function interface
    - bool.t didn't make it into 2.002 (touch problem?)
    - fftw.t test shouldn't rely on another module
    - PDL::Doc: support input from more than one file
    - Slatec/Makefile.PL: #include "g2c.h" seems unneccesary (and
        leeds to trouble on my debian 2.1 system)
    - PGPLOT patch from pdl-porters
    - Robin's Basic/Math patches

2.003
Christian Pellegrin
    - Patch to add an interface to the GSL
      (GNU Scientific Library) package. 
    - Patch to compile under perl5.005_57
    - Patch to add an interface to the FFTW
      library. (A free C FFT library including
          multi-dimensional, real, and parallel transforms)

Christian Soller
    - Patch to add 'any' and 'all' functions to use for comparison
          operations. (e.g. This enables things like any($pdl == 3.2)
           or all($pdl > 0) )
    - Patch to picnorgb test to fix greyscale and rgb 
          generation on some platforms.
    - Misc Patch: Make Image.pm return 1. 
          Make the gaussian fit routines use the correct
          xvals.
        
Karl Glazebrook:
    - Patch to Basic/Core/Basic.pm to fix bug in 
          centre=> when operating on pre-existing array.

John Cerney:
    - Put File::Spec in the PREREQ_PM list. (PDL now 
          requires File::Spec since PDL2.002)
    - Removed of ExtUtils::F77 from the distribution.
          Added ExtUtils::F77 to the PREREQ_PM list.
          (ExtUtils::F77 is already on CPAN separately.
           Having it also distributed with PDL causes
           confusion.)
        - Fixed cumuprodover docs to be similar to
          cumusumover.
    - Fixed typo in squaretotri function. (na
      changed to mna)
    - Fixed IO/FlexRaw to find properly find the
          howbig function.
    - Fixed export of rasc and rcube in IO/misc/
          misc.pd.

Brian Craft:
    - Patch to FastFaw.pm to fix sysread problems when
          reading from fifos.

Lupe Christoph:
    - Patch to OpenGL.xs to compile with perlio/sfio.
             

Brain Warner:
    - Patch so t/poly.t doesn't fail if Slatec not 
          installed.


Robin Williams:
    - Added Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) function.
    - Patch to IO/Browser/hists/dec_osf.pl to fix
          small syntax in -D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
          define flag.
    - Patch to Basic/Core/pdlthread.c to clarify
          error messages when barfing.
    - Patch to fix problems with generate.p and
          OpenGL on Solaris. 


Helmut Jarausch:
    - Change to pldcore.c to fix problem compiling on
          a IRIX6.5.3 box using perl 5.005_57

Doug Burke:
    - Patch to iis.pd to allow the user
          to change the title of an image
          displayed with iis().
    - Patch to IO/Misc/misc.pd:
        1) Added option PERLCOLS so you can now read
               in columns into perl arrays at the same
               time as reading in data into piddles.

        2) Changed the meaning of the 'c' parameter
               in the LINES option. It will only affect
               you if you use LINES together with 
               INCLUDE/EXCLUDE.

        3) It now complains if you forget to surround
                patterns by //

         4) It will also warn you (if $PDL::verbose is true)
                if no data is read in from a file.
    - Patch to PP.pod docs to clearup PRIV/CODE usage.

          only include lines matching a pattern
          exclude lines matching a pattern
          only use a specified range of line numbers

          This is useful for making RPMs.

Joshua Pritikin:
    - Patch to pdlcore.c moving some #defines around
      to improve portability between perl versions.

Kristian Nielsen

        - Removed reference to PDL being only at 'alpha release'
          in Indexing.pod.
        - Updated Christian Soeller's email address in all files.
        - Clarified docs on the RMS element returned by the stats
          function.
    - Changed how $PDL::VERSION is set so CPAN will pick it
          up correctly:
           * PDL::VERSION is now set directly in PDL.pm
       * Makefile.PL reads $PDL::VERSION from PDL.pm and
         auto-generates Basic/Version.pm

    Includes all the fairly conservative changes. More radical
    changes to come.

    - Patch to where function in primitive.pd to fix 
       bug in ($i,$j,$k) = where($x,$y,$z, $x+5>0)
        - Added PDL::Fit-Gaussion Module
    - Patch to Core.pm so you can say $a = float(3,4,5)
          just as you can say $a = pdl(3,4,5).
    - Patch to slices.pd to export the dice and dice_axis
      functions.

Robert Schwebel
    - Patch for the "perldl" shell that does the following:

        2.) Introduce "quit" equivalent to "exit"
        3.) some linebreaks to fit comments into 80 char terminals

Christian Soeller:
    - Commented out the close(STDERR) lines in pnd.pd to fix a 
      problem where the output from a 'die' is not seen for 
      certain test cases after using rpic/wpic from PDL::IO::Pic.

        - Fixed a problem in pdlapi.c where some vaffine optimizations
          had been broken by in a previous version. (Karl also added
          a test case to complain if this is broken again.)

Doug Burke:
    - Patch to clean up some of the PGPLOT documentation.

Harry Felder:
    - Patch to Basic/Math/Makefile.PL to not depend on PWD 
      environment variable.

Doug Hunt:

      is created from a perl structure using
      pdl(), float(), double(), etc.

Tim Jenness:

          checks that the piddle doesn't get too small, so that 
          if you input a (100, 1, 1, 1) image, it will be 
          treated as a (100,1) image by PGPLOT.

    - Modified PP.pod to get rid of 'head3' errors from the pod2man 
          converters
    - Modified PDL.pm PDL::Lite.pm , PDL::LiteF.pm so that the $VERSION would

      creating false html references from .pod text that contained
      '=head' as examples.
    - Updates to Doc/mkhtmldoc.pl to fix most problems with html documents
      not referencing each other correctly. In order to not change multiple
          .pod documents and documentation in .pm files, html docs will now be
          installed in ..../site_perl/PDL/htmldocs/PDL instead of 
      ..../site_perl/PDL/htmldocs. (If installing over a previous version,
      the html files in .../site_perl/PDL/htmldocs should be deleted to
      avoid confusion.

Robin Williams:
    - FFT test file addition (t/fft.t)

    - Changes to compile with perl5.005

Anton Berezin:
    - Change for Browser to compile with freebsd

1.9902
Tjl:
 - fix pdlcore.c to work with MAGIC hashes, to enable really
   wild constructions to come
 - twiddle with flexraw.t
 - PP cleanup: let 'SIZE' be used in RedoDimsCode. (needs to be cleaned
   up from the other kind of access to this.. also need '$PDL(a)')
 - null = just flag, so 0-dimensions are now allowed.
 - allow which to take other types for mask as well... - required
   cleaning PP to make RedoDimsCode be parsed just like Code, except
   without threadloop. Seems to work nicely.
   (I needed to take ($a == byte 5)->which for a large byte $a and
   was horrified to find that my program grew to dozens of Mb)
   !!! Note: possible incompatibility: before a floating value 0<v<1
   would be interpreted as false, now true - but more logical this
   way.
 - where to take multiple arguments before the mask,
   to map them all through the mask.
 - add 'isnull' to Core.xs
 - Basic/Gen/PP/PDLCode.pm to 'use strict', just in case...
 - add 'Config.pm' to help with tests
    - flexraw.t to use this
    - Makefile.PLs to set the results of the tests.
    - Maybe add PDL::Config_user later to store original
      config hash values from user.
 - threadover to clear NOMYDIMS flag.
Raphael:

 - fix TriD/Graph.pm to not barf when several graphs were removed
 - Fix mmapped piddle freeing for fastraw - now magickable.
 - Fix howbig, zeroes, Types stuff to accept PDL::Type objects
   instead of numbers in more places, e.g. FastRaw. fastraw.t updated
 - Removed TriD/Vertices.pm Lib/DataPresenter.pm
 - removed some of the old crud in Core.pm
 - Made Pod scanner not look into Pod::Parser.
 - lots of doc fixes, moving docs into the new format.
 - mkhtmldoc.pl: emulate "mkdir -p" when installing
 - Doc/Doc/Perldl.pm: allow e.g. 'new' to get 'PDL::new' to save typing.
 - standardize "3-d", "3-D" and "3d" into "3D".
 - Die on errors in evals in Basic/*.pm!!! (e.g. dynaloader unresolved
   symbols are now brought to light).
 - fix "GetHistory" bug by checking for "can".
 - Remove PCARout & PCA, as not really useful in present form !!!
Robin:
 - mconf.h osf warnings patch

1.96_01

 - TJL's jumbo patch
     - stuff into Basic/Math
     - TriD/MathGraph, for display of graphs in three
       dimensions, by finding an appropriate representation
       via a molecular dynamics-type search
 - Christian's clipping patch
 - set -ve indice patch
 - added my wcols() to PDL::IO::Misc
 - Lite.pm bug (Shawn)
 - Robin's mconf.h patch and Kaj's erfi.t test inserted
 - Christians type() patch
 - Christians const.c patch for IRIX
 - added Christian's COPYING suggestion
 - heroically went through and changed all the copyright messages
   on the docs to conform to the new standard
 - fixed (c) notice in Core.pm docs, others still need to be
   done
 - better explanation of GenericTypes and Pars in PP.pod
 - improved scantree.pl (portable cwd).
 - HTML docs!! - thanks to Christian's mkhtmldoc.pl (some changes)
   into the distribution. included a hacked Pod::Html (from perl
   5.004) as PDL::Pod::Html Still not great but gives us something
   to work from. Some links still broken - patches welcome. See
   file:/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/PDL/HtmlDocs
   for docs after 'make install'
 - TJL's average() patch and primitive.t patch
 - Docs now only built during 'make install' or 'make doctest'
   (which builds them under ./blib), this saves them being built
   unnecessarily during 'make'
 - PDL::Slatec now works on any system with a f77 compiler.
   All unused slatec functions were got rid of which fortunately
   removed all the ones with COMPLEX arguments. Also changed
   prototype generation which removes warnings on build.
   Added local copy of ExtUtils::F77 back into dist and WITH_SLATEC
   option to perldl.conf (undef by default for auto-decision).
 - removed Example/PP - out of date


1.95_07

 - applied Christian's mega-patch - but there were problems
   I had to fix manually.
   (a) his maga-patch didn't include the patch to pdl.h he had
       already made.
   (b) the change should have been made to pdl.h.PL in any case.
 - fixed NAME in Indexing.pod
 - may have fixed executable install problem of 'perldl' shell
 - fixed PDL.pm being lost from docs db
 - Robin's problems 'compiling pdl 1.54_06 Basic/Math' patch 17/12/97

   Rejected because of following error (Linux/gcc)

     const.c:80: parse error before `3.14159265358979323846'
     const.c:99: parse error before `__extension__'
     const.c:99: parse error before `}'

   Can the patch be revised?

 - Robin's at() accepts -ve indices patch. Can we have set() to?
 - removed 'docscan' and 'pdlhead2item' from MANIFEST - OK ?

1.95_06

  KGB

  - FITS patch
  - restored cc8compt fibonacci from pdl-porters archive (!)
  - fixed misc module name problems in tests (thanks Bob!)
  - Robin and Christian's help patches
  - Robin's Object.pod patch
  - Achim: chmod 0755 on Doc/*.PL,
  - Achim wanted pdldoc.db in archlib, ignored this (don't understand
    why)
  - put fudge in ops.pd to get rid of that stupid compiler warning
    with abs() and byte/ushort types
  - rebuilt MANIFEST hope it is OK now

  - introduced new barf(...) routine in Core.pm and pdlcore.c
    [see help barf]

    we should use barf(...) in C and Perl code instead of croak etc.

    Note the barf engine is written in Perl, so is easy to customize!

  - changed references to 'croak' in pd/xs/c code to barf(..)
    or Perl_croak where appropriate
  - changed references to 'croak' in various .pm files to barf()
    where appropriate
  - croak #defined to barf() in pdlcore.h to catch the use in
    xsubpp (..fingers crossed..). Perhaps future xsubpp will allow
    an override of this.

  - renamed PDL::Io:: heirarchy PDL::IO:: for consistency with Perl IO::

1.95_05

  KGB

  - Renamed PDL.pdl_make_physical PDL.make_physical (woops!) - ditto
    physdims().

  - Changed type config. Now Types.pm pdl.h pdlsimple.h are generated
    AUTOMATICALLY from Types.pm.PL pdl.h.PL and pdlsimple.h.PL
    files using perl Config information. int size issue is now handled
    from perl config information. Lots of potential for more flexibility.
    Hope this doesn't break Alpha stuff by mistake!

  - Revised PDL::CallExt. Now uses make_physical rather than PP and allows
    unlimited args in the same way as PDL-1.11. Ought to be more compiler
    friendly too! Put callext.t back.

  - Added 'dog' and 'cat'

1.95_04

  KGB

  - Added glEnable/DisableClientState to dontfunc in OpenGL
  - Doug: added fake MAIN_ to cfft.f in Slatec for old g77s
  - Achim's patches of 4/12
  - my IIS changes
  - Robin's random and Inf/NaN patches of 4/12
  - Christian:  'minor doc polishing Core.pm+primitive.pd'
  - Christian: INSTALL patches.
  - Christian: 'docs in Doc/Doc/Perldl.pm'
  - Robin's minor perldl docs patch
  - Restored my missing hist() patch and test of Oct 10th (sic)
  - Achim's suggestions on help 'help' and help 'perldl', '?' and
    allow no quotes (with warning)
  - Added solaris_2 hints file for OpenGL
  - Robins perldl pod patches but NOT 'l' as a synonym for 'last'
    (I don't like this as 'last' is a perl keyword)

1.95_03

  KGB:

  - Various small changes to TriD/test*.pl scripts. Renamed as *.p
  - minor TriD changes to comply with new zeroes() etc.
  - moved tests all into one top level t/ directory.
  - corrected PDL::initialise and convert (Christian)
  - Robin's primitive.pd patch
  - callext.t temporarily disabled - I will rewrite the module.
  - Minor changes to 'Doc'.
  - TriD renamed to PDL::Graphics::TriD

1.95_02 [emergency bug fixing release]

 KGB:

 - Redid all the zeroes/ones/[xyrz]vals/[g]random/sequence stuff
   someone please please give me some objective advice :-)
 - Added Robin's new FFT
 - 3 byte change to Pnm.pm for new zeroes()
 - added make_physical and make_physdims to PDL struct

1.95_01

KGB:

 - Added Cephes code to PDL::Math as backup, changed signature of
   jn, yn.
 - changed scalar convesion in pdlcore.c SvPDLV() - '2.0' is now
   double, '2' is now int. [Uses SvNOK SvIOK etc] - changed
   Basic/t/conv.t to comply.
 - Added magic {PDL} = code ref hook. And put test/example in
   subclass.t
 - random() is now like zeroes() and both allow type/dim and
   $x template arguments. New arg proc. method to support this.
 - Added grandom().
 - Ressurected PDL::Exporter (q.v.). Much simpler than bizarrity
   in PDL-1.11. Now 'use PDL::Mod' defaults to loading ':Func'.
   Provision for noimports. Less typing!!!! Modified docs too.
 - Renamed PDL::Graphics::PG PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT
 - Reverted to manpages named PDL::FAQ.1, PDL::Dataflow.1, etc.
   This is simpler and maintains consistence between manpage
   and pod browsers. Fixed all the text links to comply.
 - small changes to Pod/ docs.
 - shut PP the hell up! Much less scary build now.
 - added Pods to files scanned in building doc database.
 - [xvyz]rvals now act like zeroes - but they now act like
    constructos so $derived->xvals does not give you what
    you expect. Need to think about this some more.

1.94_09

KGB: NOTE ONE MAJOR INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE [random]

 - removed PDL_OPTIONS - PDL_CONFIG for everything. I think this is
   better, e.g. if we want debugging we can add Debugging=>1 to
   %PDL_CONFIG.
 - changed use of PDL_CONFIG - see INSTALL. I think this is simpler.
 - made Karma conform with above - and simplified.
 - changed Callext arg limit to 10 to avoid compiler explosions.
 - integrated PDL::Doc, created PDL::Doc::Perldl.
 - manifying is now back from the .pm file rather then the .pd
   (this is a better design now pod are semi-generated from PP)
 - Christian's patches of 25/11/97:
   'Core.xs and pdlapi.c'
   'test' for Io::Pic
 - added docs for Doc field in PP.pod and made one-line a special case
 - Moved statistical functions from Basic.pm to Primitive.pm
 - Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and
   lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and
   lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and
   lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and
   lots and lotsof miscellaneous docs.
 - Robin's browser patch of 26/11
 - Core now completely OO - i.e. none of the stuff below Basic/ export
   routines to each other and it still works!
 - changed occurences of foo(sig) to use '=for sig' as this seems to
   work better with Pod::Parser.
 - made random $x=random($y), i.e. to get inplace now random(inplace $y)
   OK?????????? This is because I think it is natural to say
   $r = random(zeroes(10,20,2)), etc.
   If this is a major headache let me know and I will change it back.
 - Docs => undef allowed - no PP docs at all (not even the sig)
 - Various changes to Docs.pm and Docs::Perldl.pm - apropos text searches
   now include module names and one-line desriptions. God I love this
   language.
 - Renamed Iutil module as ImageRGB - hope this is OK???
 - changed name of 'inv' to 'matinv' in Slatec for consistency
   with matmult in Primitive.

1.94_06

Christian:
  - lots of things.
Robin:
  - add type to PdlParObj.pm
Achim (req):
  - Version to Core.pm
Tjl:
  - New configuration.

1.94_05
... Not recorded. Real threading for example.

1.94_02

Lots of changes by everyone, e.g. FFT, Browser, ...

1.94_01

Christian:
  - simplescaler
  - VRML !!!

Achim:
  - misc.t patch
  - Browser hints

Karl:
  - autocreation memleak patch

Robin:
  - flexraw test correction

Jarle:
  - Ops.pd: prevent creation of -0

Tuomas:
  - Core bug fixes for e.g. $a->slice("...")->index(...) .= foo,
    originally reported by Christian.
  - mandel.pl demo

Others??

1.94

Kgb:
  - Autoload patch
  - subclass fixes: pdl_destroy + test.
  - sethdr + gethdr ref counts
  - rfits/wfits update

Christian:
  - where etc.
  - imag3d without lines

Kaj Wiik:
  - tsimp.pl use correction

Achim:
  - Tk patch

Tjl:
  - Change PP.pm to really allow Pars => 'a(tri=>3)' to happen.
    Embarrassingly, this was a one-liner.
  - OpenGL libs changed to take both GL and MesaGL.
  - openglq.pd: use tri=3
  - rout.pd ditto
  - TriD.pm: documentation updates & 'LINE' as context
  - Graph.pm: coordinate axes labels!
  - test7.pl: some niceties.
  - make the thread incs etc. into register variables.
    this should, with a good compiler, result in some speedup.
  - primitive.pd: histogram -> histogram + whistogram,
    more thread-friendly.
  - correct foo.t
  - TriD: add imag3d_ns (no surface) and minor twiddling.

1.93_06

Kgb:
  - PP: use PDLOBJ for the stub subs.
  - Basic.pm: sec, ins fixes - use "int" to ensure type of coords.
  - PG.pm fixes
  - IIS fixes

Achim:
  - ws fixes for docs, pptest.t
  - "small perldl fixes"

Tjl:
  - start making support for piddle-controlled (e.g. affine)
    transformations by using magic.
  - Core.xs: setdims should now work with dataflow properly.
  - Core.xs, pdl.h, pdlapi.h, PP.pm: add support for
    foofunctions and PDL::Trans objects. These are a very basic way
    of accessing the internals of transformations so that
    in the future, as the mechanism is improved,
    you can e.g. change your slice from outside.
    The current level of support is enough to make a routine
    that takes a slice of one dimension and is given offset and
    increment and n in that.
  - TriD:
     - add test8.pl to demonstrate an use of foofunctions.
     - document OpenGLQ and Rout
     - add gl_triangles_n for shaded triangles
     - TriD.pm:
        - realcoords: add more contexts
        - make the default routines all plot a graph
     - GL.pm:
        - add glPolygonOffset call to GL::Window in order to
      get good-looking imag3d always
    - change the colors to somewhat lighter ones.
    - delete_viewports -> clear_viewports (like clear_objects)
    - new argument to twiddle
     - Graph.pm:
        - default names for dataseries
    - waffle less
    - support changed dataseries
     - Image.pm:
        - use realcoords COLOR context
     - Lines.pm:
        - start deprecation by renaming package
     - Objects.pm:
        - realcoords support better by r_type
    - waffle less
    - SLattice_S to draw shaded lattices
    - tests changed somewhat.
  - Core.xs: remove pdl_unpackint unnecessarity
  - Basic.pm: make axisvals return zeroes if not enough dimensions.
  - Opt/Simplex/Simplex.pm: add support for temperature a la
    Numerical Recipes.
  - (Christian) - remove Data::Dumper from FastRaw.

1.93_05

Tjl:
  - PP: several changes, basically inline *size and *incs into
    register variables to speed up execution.
  - TriD:
     - add TriD/Rout for misc C routines for TriD
        - add a routine to do flowing combination of 3 piddles into
          coordinates or colours
     - this makes the test3.pl data_changed stuff work again.
     - imagrgb now defaults to a whole-window image - no reason
       to make it rotatable with the mouse.

1.93_04

Tjl:
  - TriD: add stuff for Tk
    - OpenGL: ConnectionNumber
    - ButtonPress + Release: more info back
    - TriD.pm: add export imagrgb
    - Control3D: small changes + TriD::Tk::post_menu
    - GL.pm: ConnectionNumber support for Tk eventloop
    - Graph.pm: minor changes
    - Image.pm: major changes, make multi-D images actually work.
      also, support for different multi-D background color.
***** NOTE: calling convention now same as with coordinates!
      this means an incompatible change.
    - added Tk.pm, rudimentary support for a menu of actions
      associated with the displayed 3D graph. Currently, can save
      the image.
    - test3.pl: change to new imagrgb calling sequence.
    - GoBoard.pm: ditto
    - test6.pl: test the Tk functionality.
    - testimg.pl: really test the multidimensional picture facility
      with an 8-D tricolor picture.
  - Io/Pnm/Pic.pm: use the new 'Func' convention
  - perldl.PL: new '-tk' option to use Tk and the Tk event loop.

1.93_03

Tjl:
  - TriD:
     - Change default controller to ArcCone
     - Graphs with axes!
  - PP:
     - EquivDimCheck now honoured
  - iis.pd: #undef Generic
  - OpenGL/Makefile.PL update + generate.PL tuning
  - Browse: manpage twiddle

1.93_02

Tjl:
  - Core/Basic.pm: use PDL::Core qw/:Func/;
  - Core/Core.xs, pdl.h, pdlapi.h: hdr stuff (untested)
  - Core/Core.xs: bugfix threadover_n to make_physical
  - Core/pdlapi.c: pdl_destroy will not destroy if an affine trans the
    child of which hasn't been allocated exists.
  - Core/pdlapi.c: pdl_changed will not try to do overeager
    optimization. Fixes flow.t bug
  - Basic/t/flow.t: enable again the tests that now work.
  - Gen/PP.pm: new '$a = inner($b,$c)' changes.
  - Slices/slices.pd: splitdim checks arguments
  - Basic/t/thread.t: semi-add new test
  - Graphics/TriD/OpenGL: new PDL::OpenGL module to enable virtualization
  - Graphics/TriD/OpenGLQ: a test for TriD virtualization of OpenGL,
    this will later on expand a lot
  - Graphics/TriD/TriD.pm & TriD/*: new docs, small changes.
  - Io/Fastraw/FastRaw.pm: don't waffle when mmapping
  - MANIFEST.SKIP: add more ignorable stuff

KGB:

  - Fixed multiple 'use PDL' etc problem for loaders.
  - "use 5.004"

1.93_01 (Kgb) MAJOR CHANGES

- these are very significant and affect code throughout the
  system so EXPECT problems. In particular note that this code
  is the new PATCHBASE.

- NEW IMPORT/EXPORT system

  PDL_OO.pm now deleted.

  PDL::Exporter is DEAD and gone!! (hooray)

  All modules now define their functions in package PDL.

  The idea is a PDL::Module now looks like this:

    package PDL::Module;

    @EXPORT_OK  = qw( sub1 sub2 ...);
    %EXPORT_TAGS = (Func=>[@EXPORT_OK]);

    @ISA    = qw( Exporter ... );

    *sub1 = \&PDL::sub1;
    sub PDL::sub1 { ... def ...}

    # If you wanted to do something special (e.g. a constructor) you can:

    sub rfits(PDL->rfits(@_)); # This gets exported
    sub PDL::rfits {
      my $class = shift;
      # etc...
    }

  i.e. the onus is entirely on the module writer.

  Thus saying 'use PDL::Module' will load (cheaply) PDL methods.
  If you want to (less cheaply) import functions say 'use PDL::Module qw/:Func/'

  PP has been modified to generate modules which follow this scheme. i.e. by
  default it stuffs its functions in to the PDL namespace, and writes stubs
  '*sub1 = \&PDL::sub1;' into the PM file. This can be changed at whim
  however.  There is a new pp function - pp_bless('MyObj') which  will change the
  default package from "PDL" to 'MyObj' in anticipation of future
  Object-Oriented PP modules. (Up to the author how he writes his module).
  Also the pp_def(PMFunc=>'...') attribute can be used to generate special
  purpose PM code instead of the default.

  Comments please, hopefully nice ones as I have spent all day changing
  code everywhere and debugging!!!

  - Karl (exhausted)


- Module defaults

  PDL.pm now loads a set of standard packages (with :Func) - including graphics
  and I/O for TPJ article and v1.11 compatibility. Thus a script with 'use PDL'
  is v1.11 compatible (modulo bug fixes!)

  Lite.pm loads only the truly fundametal core, with no imports, for method
  speed freaks. Thus a lean script need only say 'use PDL::Lite' plus whatever
  else it needs.

  I hope various other sets of meta-modules (PDL::Astronomy, PDL::Medical) etc
  will follow this simple scheme. Basically there is nothing sacred about
  'use PDL' anymore - it is just one of many loaders.

- perldl shell

  The 'perldl' script sources C<~/.perldlrc> if present or falls back to
  C<PDL/default.perldlrc>. The latter just does the standard 'use PDL'

  Thus by creating a C<~/.perldlrc> you are free to 'use PDL::Lite' or
  whatever set of modules you fancy without impinging on v1.11 compatibility.

  I think this is a rather elegant solution to all our aesthetic tastes
  (namespace polluters vs method maniacs, module hoarders vs leany
  meanies) while still ensuring script compatibility with v1.11.

  I hope everyone is happy with this!
