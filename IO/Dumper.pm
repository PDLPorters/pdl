=head1 NAME

PDL::IO::Dumper -- data dumping for structs with PDLs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package allows you cleanly to save and restore complex data structures
which include PDLs, as ASCII strings and/or transportable ASCII files.  It
exports four functions into your namespace: sdump, fdump, frestore, and
deep_copy.

PDL::IO::Dumper traverses the same types of structure that Data::Dumper
knows about, because it uses a call to Data::Dumper.  Unlike Data::Dumper
it doesn't crash when accessing PDLs.

The PDL::IO::Dumper routines have a slightly different syntax than
Data::Dumper does: you may only dump a single scalar perl expression
rather than an arbitrary one.  Of course, the scalar may be a ref to
whatever humongous pile of spaghetti you want, so that's no big loss.

The output string is intended to be about as readable as Dumper's
output is for non-PDL expressions. To that end, small PDLs (up to 8
elements) are stored as inline perl expressions, midsized PDLs (up to
200 elements) are stored as perl expressions above the main data
structure, and large PDLs are stored as FITS files that are uuencoded
and included in the dump string. (You have to have access to either 
uuencode(1) or the CPAN module Convert::UU for this to work).

No attempt is made to shrink the output string -- for example, inlined
PDL expressions all include explicit reshape() and typecast commands,
and uuencoding expands stuff by a factor of about 1.5.  So your data
structures will grow when you dump them. 

=head1 Bugs

It's still possible to break this code and cause it to dump core, for
the same reason that Data::Dumper crashes.  In particular, other
external-hook variables aren't recognized (for that a more universal
Dumper would be needed) and will still exercise the Data::Dumper crash.  
This is by choice:  (A) it's difficult to recognize which objects
are actually external, and (B) most everyday objects are quite safe.

Another shortfall of Data::Dumper is that it doesn't recognize tied objects.
This might be a Good Thing or a Bad Thing depending on your point of view, 
but it means that PDL::IO::Dumper includes a kludge to handle the tied
Astro::FITS::Header objects associated with FITS headers (see the rfits 
documentation in PDL::IO::Misc for details).

There's currently no reference recursion detection, so a non-treelike
reference topology will cause Dumper to buzz forever.  That will
likely be fixed in a future version.  Meanwhile a warning message finds
likely cases.

Dump a data structure to a string.

sdump dumps a single complex data structure into a string.  You restore
the data structure by eval-ing the string.  Since eval is a builtin, no
convenience routine exists to use it.

=head2 fdump

=for ref

Dump a data structure to a file

=for usage

  use PDL::IO::Dumper;
  fdump(<VAR>,$filename);
  ...
  <VAR> = frestore($filename);

=for description

fdump dumps a single complex data structure to a file.  You restore the
data structure by eval-ing the perl code put in the file.  A convenience
routine (frestore) exists to do it for you.

I suggest using the extension '.pld' or (for non-broken OS's) '.pdld'
to distinguish Dumper files.  That way they are reminiscent of .pl
files for perl, while still looking a little different so you can pick
them out.  You can certainly feed a dump file straight into perl (for
syntax checking) but it will not do much for you, just build your data
structure and exit.

frestore() is a convenience function that just reads in the named

=head2 PDL::IO::Dumper::big_PDL

=for ref

Identify whether a PDL is ``big'' [Internal routine]

Internal routine takes a PDL and returns a boolean indicating whether
it's small enough for direct insertion into the dump string.  If 0, 
it can be inserted.  Larger numbers yield larger scopes of PDL.  
1 implies that it should be broken out but can be handled with a couple
of perl commands; 2 implies full uudecode treatment.

PDLs with Astro::FITS::Header objects as headers are taken to be FITS
files and are always treated as huge, regardless of size.

=for ref

Turn a PDL into a 1-part perl expr [Internal routine]

Internal routine that takes a PDL and returns a perl string that evals to the
PDL.  It should be used with care because it doesn't dump headers and 
it doesn't check number of elements.  The point here is that numbers are
dumped with the correct precision for their storage class.  Things we
don't know about get stringified element-by-element by their builtin class,
which is probably not a bad guess.

Generate 1- or 2-part expr for a PDL [Internal routine]

Internal routine that produces commands defining a PDL.  You supply
(<PDL>, <name>) and get back two strings: a prepended command string and an
expr that evaluates to the final PDL.  PDL is the PDL you want to dump.  
<inline> is a flag whether dump_PDL is being called inline or before
the inline dump string (0 for before; 1 for in).  <name> is the
name of the variable to be assigned (for medium and large PDLs,
which are defined before the dump string and assigned unique IDs).
