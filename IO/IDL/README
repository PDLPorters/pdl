IDL has updated their status to allow reading of IDL SAV data
files from other languages.  This implementation is based on
a 3rd party spec by Craig Markwardt based on the IDL 4.x and 5.x
save files.  It cannot read save files created by IDL 8.x.

From Joe Hourcle, who worked to get permission to distribute
this code:


In January of 2011, our group had a meeting with our NASA account
rep, Amanda O'Connor. I brought up that they had announced at
the IDL User Meeting at either the 2009 or 2010 Fall AGU Meeting
that there was now a python library to read IDL save files, and I
asked what was the process to be allowed to read them from Perl.

This was the response that I received. ...
