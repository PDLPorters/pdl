=head1 NAME

PDL::IO::Storable - helper functions to make PDL usable with Storable

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Storable;
  use PDL::IO::Storable;
  $hash = {
            'foo' => 42,
            'bar' => zeroes(23,45),
          };
  store $hash, 'perlhash.dat';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Storable> implements object persistence for Perl data structures that can
contain arbitrary Perl objects. This module implements the relevant methods to
be able to store and retrieve piddles via Storable.

# routines to make PDL work with Storable >= 1.03

# pdlpack() serializes a piddle, while pdlunpack() unserializes it. Earlier
# versions of PDL didn't control for endianness, type sizes and enumerated type
# values; this made stored data unportable across different architectures and
# PDL versions. This is no longer the case, but the reading code is still able
# to read the old files. The old files have no meta-information in them so it's
# impossible to read them correctly with 100% accuracy, but we try to make an
# educated guess
#
# Old data format:
#
#  int type
#  int ndims
#  int dims[ndims]
#  data
#
# Note that here all the sizes and endiannesses are the native. This is
# un-portable. Furthermore, the "type" is an enum, and its values could change
# between PDL versions. Here I assume that the old format input data is indeed
# native, so the old data files have the same portability issues, but at least
# things will remain working and broken in the same way they were before
#
#
# New format:
#
#  uint64 0xFFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF # meant to be different from the old-style data
#  char type[16]                # ' '-padded, left-aligned type string such as 'PDL_LL'
#  uint32 sizeof(type)          # little-endian
#  uint32 one                   # native-endian. Used to determine the endianness
#  uint64 ndims                 # little-endian
#  uint64 dims[ndims]           # little-endian
#  data
#
# The header data is all little-endian here. The data is stored with native
# endianness. On load it is checked, and a swap happens, if it is required
