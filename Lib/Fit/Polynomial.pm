=head1 NAME

PDL::Fit::Polynomial - routines for fitting with polynomials

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains routines for doing simple
polynomial fits to data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $yfit = fitpoly1d $data;


=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 fitpoly1d

=for ref

Fit 1D polynomials to data using min chi^2 (least squares)

=for usage

 Usage: ($yfit, [$coeffs]) = fitpoly1d [$xdata], $data, $order, [Options...]

=for sig

  Signature: (x(n); y(n); [o]yfit(n); [o]coeffs(order))

Uses a standard matrix inversion method to do a least
squares/min chi^2 polynomial fit to data. Order=2 is a linear
fit (two parameters).

Returns the fitted data and optionally the coefficients.

One can thread over extra dimensions to do multiple fits (except
the order can not be threaded over - i.e. it must be one fixed
scalar number like "4").

The data is normalised internally to avoid overflows (using the
mean of the abs value) which are common in large polynomial
series but the returned fit, coeffs are in
unnormalised units.


=for example

  $yfit = fitpoly1d $data,2; # Least-squares line fit
  ($yfit, $coeffs) = fitpoly1d $x, $y, 4; # Fit a cubic
  
  $fitimage = fitpoly1d $image,3  # Fit a quadratic to each row of an image
  
  $myfit = fitpoly1d $line, 2, {Weights => $w}; # Weighted fit

=for options  

  Options:
     Weights    Weights to use in fit, e.g. 1/$sigma**2 (default=1)

May not work too well for data with large dynamic range.
