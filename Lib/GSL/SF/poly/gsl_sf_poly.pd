PDL::GSLSF::POLY - PDL interface to GSL Special Functions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an interface to the Special Function package present in the GNU Scientific Library. 

NOTE: this should actually be PDL::POLY for consistency but I don't want to get into edits
changing the directory structure at this time.  These fixes should allow things to build.
