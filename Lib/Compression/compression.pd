=head1 NAME

PDL::Compression - compression utilities

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These routines generally accept some data as a PDL and compress it
into a smaller PDL.  Algorithms typically work on a single dimension
and thread over other dimensions, producing a threaded table of
compressed values if more than one dimension is fed in.

The Rice algorithm, in particular, is designed to be identical to the 
RICE_1 algorithm used in internal FITS-file compression (see PDL::IO::FITS).


=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PDL::Compression

 ($b,$asize) = $a->rice_compress();
 $c = $b->rice_expand($asize);

Squishes an input PDL along the 0 dimension by Rice compression.  In
scalar context, you get back only the compressed PDL; in list context,
you also get back ancillary information that is required to uncompress
the data with rice_uncompress.  

Multidimensional data are threaded over - each row is compressed
separately, and the returned PDL is squished to the maximum compressed
size of any row.  If any of the streams could not be compressed (the
algorithm produced longer output), the corresponding length is set to -1
and the row is treated as if it had length 0.

Rice compression only works on integer data types -- if you have
floating point data you must first quantize them.

The underlying algorithm is identical to the Rice compressor used in
CFITSIO (and is used by PDL::IO::FITS to load and save compressed FITS
images).

The optional blocksize indicates how many samples are to be compressed
as a unit; it defaults to 32.

How it works:

Rice compression is a subset of Golomb compression, and works on data sets
where variation between adjacent samples is typically small compared to the
dynamic range of each sample.  In this implementation (originally written
by Richard White and contributed to CFITSIO in 1999), the data are divided
into blocks of samples (by default 32 samples per block).  Each block 
has a running difference applied, and the difference is bit-folded to make
it positive definite.  High order bits of the difference stream are discarded,
and replaced with a unary representation; low order bits are preserved.  Unary
representation is very efficient for small numbers, but large jumps could
give rise to ludicrously large bins in a plain Golomb code; such large jumps
("high entropy" samples) are simply recorded directly in the output stream.

Working on astronomical or solar image data, typical compression ratios of 
2-3 are achieved.
