This file has some information on how to get
access to the latest PDL sources (mainly of
interest for potential developers). This should
not be confused with the latest public release
which will always be available from CPAN (if you
don't know what that is check the FAQ).

Public Git repository at sourceforge.net
--------------------------------------------

From version PDL-2.4.4 onwards the source
distribution is in a publicly accessible Git
repository. The project is hosted at the
sourceforge site at

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdl/pdl

Starting from the above URL you will find
directions on how to check out the current
sources, browse the Git repository online, etc.

If you would like to actively contribute to PDL
development don't hesitate to contact one of the
project admins (listed at the above URL) to apply
for write access to the repository. We strongly
believe in the power of open source development!

If you do not know how to use Git try 'man git'
or have a look at some of the online tutorials
available on the web.

The main Git home page is at

  http://www.git-scm.org/

and two good online Git references are the Git
User's Manual at

  http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html

and Git Magic at

PDL Developer Guidelines:
-------------------------

The following guidelines are for any developer that has
access to the PDL Git repository.

1) Before committing a change with new files to the repository
   you should update:

    - MANIFEST (if files were added, using 'make manifest')
    - MANIFEST.SKIP (if applicable)

2) Make sure you add a test case in the 't' directory for any
   significant additional capability you add to PDL.  Please
   use Test::More or one the of the Test modules available via
   perl modules rather than doing-it-yourself!
   
3) Please include POD documentation for any functions you add to 
   the distribution. 

    - See Basic/Core/Core.pm for an example of including POD
      documentation in .pm files. 
    - See Basic/Core/Primitive/Primitive.pd for an example of 
      including POD documentation in PDL .pd files.
    - read the documentation in PDL::Doc for a detailed description of
      the PDL documentation conventions.

4) Don't commit before you successfully built and passed 'make test'.
 
5) Bugs reported on the list should be entered into the bug database
   and bugs closed when a patch has been committed as a fix. (Primary
   responsibility for this task is the pumpking, but other devels
   should be able to help.)
  

PDL Developer Notes:
--------------------

A (small) collection of random musings to note if you feel the need to
improve or add to PDL (please do):

*) git supports file-by-file commits so it is helpful to commit
   your changes to git a little at a time where each commit
   corresponds to a single change.  This makes it easy in the
   log to determine what was done and to locate any desired
   commit in case of issues that need to be resolved.

*) Need help?

See the pdl-porters email list; details for subscription and access to
the archives can be found on the PDL web page at:

  http://pdl.sourceforge.net/maillists/
 
*) Access to PDL's configuration

If you need to access the configuration for PDL then use the
%PDL::Config variable. Prior to 2.4.1 this was a mess since you
had to use %PDL_CONFIG within Makefile.PL and PDL::Config from
*.pm/tests. The build process has been changed (I hesitate to say
"cleaned up" ;) to just use %PDL::Config consistently throughout.

- %PDL::Config is automatically available to you when you are in a
  Makefile.PL within the PDL distribution. You can change the hash
  and these changes will be stored in the PDL::Config module. You
  should only change values when it makes sense (e.g. if the user
  has specified that a module should be built but you find out this
  is not possible).

- Otherwise you can say 'use PDL::Config;' or - perhaps something like
    eval 'require "' . whereami_any() . '/Core/Config.pm";';
  where whereami_any() is from PDL::Core::Dev;

*) Location of temporary files

Please use $PDL::Config{TEMPDIR} for the directory in which to
place temporary files (e.g. when IO::File::new_tmpfile() is not
appropriate). This will make it easier for distributions to package
PDL since there will only be one place they need to change if the
default value causes problems.

This *includes* test cases as well as for Makefile.PL's!

  

-------------------------------------------------------------
Notes on transferring an external PDL module to the PDL
        source tree for distribution with PDL.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose you have developed a PDL module that resides in a
standalone source tree. You typically will need to have PDL
installed on your system before you can build this module.

If you wish to migrate the module into the PDL distribution
you will need to make certain changes to the module source
in order to built in the PDL distribution. You will need to
removed dependecies on a pre-existing PDL installation for
configuration and build of your module. This is because as
part of the PDL distribution, it is possible that PDL has
never been installed. Build processes based on PDL will then
fail.

Following is some specific advice that can help you do this.

[ These notes are very preliminary and are expected to be ]
[ revised and/or replaced by improved documentation.      ]

Changes that must be made to files in your module source tree
if you are building the module from a .pd file :

Makefile.PL:
-- You must remove the line 'use PDL::Core::Dev;'.

-- The line 'PDL::Core::Dev->import();' must be present

-- You must change the call from 'pdlpp_postamble' to a call to
   'pdlpp_postamble_int' (with the same arguments.)

-- It seems that most modules in the PDL source use 
   VERSION_FROM => '../../Basic/Core/Version.pm',
   but not all of them in order that their version tracks
   the PDL release version.  It is possible to maintain
   separate versioning even within the PDL source tree but
   it may make things confusing.

Make certain that you make these changes to each 'Makefile.PL' in
your source tree.


Changes to the existing PDL source tree:

-- Edit the 'Makefile.PL' in the directory above your module source
   to add your module directory name to
   'DIR => [ qw/Module1 AnotherModule / ]'.

-- Add your test files (.t files) to the PDL/t directory renaming if
   required to avoid namespace conflicts.

-- Does your module depend on any libraries or external
   programs ?  If so, doocument the required programs with version
   numbers in PDL/DEPENDENCIES and add the PREREQ_* option to the
   main Makefile.PL if required.

-- If your module requires external libraries or header files,
   add a section to perldl.conf.  The hash values with be available
   in your module's 'Makefile.PL' as $PDL::Config{WITH_MYMODULE},...
