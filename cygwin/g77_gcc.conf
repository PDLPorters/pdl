# Mandatory.
# The FORTRAN compiler to use.

# Mandatory.
# The FORTRAN compiler flags to use when compiling the pgplot library.
# (NB. makemake prepends -c to $FFLAGC where needed)
 
   FFLAGC="-Wall -O2"

# Mandatory.
# The FORTRAN compiler flags to use when compiling fortran demo programs.
# This may need to include a flag to tell the compiler not to treat
# backslash characters as C-style escape sequences
 
   FFLAGD="-fno-backslash -I/usr/include"

# Mandatory.
# The C compiler to use.

# The C compiler flags to use when compiling C demo programs.
 
   CFLAGD="-Wall -O2"

# Optional: Only needed if the cpgplot library is to be compiled.

   SHARED_LD=""

# Optional:
# On systems such as Solaris 2.x, that allow specification of the

# Compiler name used on Next systems to compile objective-C files.

# Compiler flags used with MCOMPL when compiling objective-C files.
 
   MFLAGC=""

# Optional: (Actually mandatory, but already defined by makemake).
# Where to look for any system-specific versions of the files in
# pgplot/sys. Before evaluating this script, makemake sets SYSDIR to
# /wherever/pgplot/sys_$OS, where $OS is the operating-system name
# given by the second command-line argument of makemake. If the
# present configuration is one of many for this OS, and it needs
# different modifications to files in pgplot/sys than the other
# configurations, then you should create a subdirectory of SYSDIR,
# place the modified files in it and change the following line to
# $SYSDIR="$SYSDIR/subdirectory_name".
