=================================================================
                        GENERAL NOTES
=================================================================
 NOTE: These install notes have been partially reviewed
 for the PDL-2.4.7 release.  It is recommended that you
 build and install PDL based on a full cygwin 1.7.5 or
 later install.  Please post to the perldl mailing list
 for help or questions regarding a cygwin install.

 Cygwin seems to have a ~300MB process memory limit
 that we have not determined how to work around.
 If you work with large data sets, you may wish to
 use the native win32 PDL with either ActiveState Perl
 or Strawberry Perl.

 Work is underway to improve the native win32 perl PDL 
 support for external dependencies so that it may be
 used, feature for feature, instead of the cygwin port.



=================================================================
                 Installing with CPAN on Cygwin
=================================================================
If you already have a full cygwin install on your PC, the
simplest way to get a basic PDL is to use the cpan shell.

This will get you all the functionality that is supported
by existing cygwin package functionality (i.e. available
from the standard Setup.exe installs).

!! NOTE: you will be asked to answer some configuration
!! questions the first time you use cpan on your system.
!! Most should be self-explanatory.

Just start up an xterm and run cpan from the bash prompt:

  bash$ cpan
  cpan> install ExtUtils::F77
  cpan> install OpenGL
  cpan> install PDL

This installs the Perl OpenGL (a.k.a POGL) module, ExtUtils::F77,
and should pull in installs for the following dependencies:

  Astro::FITS::Header
  Convert::UU
  Data::Dumper
  File::Spec
  Filter::Util::Call
  Text::Balanced
  Inline

if they are not already installed or of a recent enough version.

This should finish with a PDL with the following functionality:

  - base PDL modules

  - PDL::IO::GD
  - PDL::GIS::Proj
  - PDL::Graphics::TriD
  - PDL::GSL::*
  - PDL::Slatec
  - PDL::Transform::Proj4



=================================================================
                Manual Configuration and Install
=================================================================
In general, the standard install process for perl modules
should work on cygwin.  If you don't want to accept the
default build options for PDL, edit the perldl.conf file.
You'll find that file in the top level PDL folder/directory.

The remaining PDL functionality depends on external libraries
and packages that must be pre-installed before installing PDL.

If you want to use other modules with external dependencies
not available through the Setup.exe from http://www.cygwin.com
then you'll need to get, build, and install the desired
libraries yourself (see the HOW-TO notes below).

The manual configure/build/install process is:

 Edit the PDL/perldl.conf file as desired


 From the bash$ prompt in the top level PDL/ directory:

  perl Makefile.PL	# configures all the Makefile
  
  make		        # builds/compiles everything
  
  make test            # run test suite
  
  make doctest         # builds online documentation
                        # and html docs


 If any tests fail (rather than skipped) you can run them
 by hand for more detailed diagnostic messages.  For
 example:

   perl -Mblib t/plplot.t 
   1..27
   ok 1 - use PDL::Graphics::PLplot;
   # Looks like you planned 27 tests but only ran 1.

   perl -Mblib t/proj_transform.t 
   1..4
   # Looks like your test died before it could output anything.

   These test failures with the number of planned tests not
   equal to the number of tests run (1) or if a test died
   before it could output anything indicate a problem with
   the DLL base addresses.  See the instructions for REBASEALL
   below.


 If PDL built ok and passed tests, you can test the interactive
 PDL shell before actually installing PDL by running from the
 PDL/ top level directory:

  perl -Mblib Perldl2/pdl2   # type quit to exit the PDL shell


 To finally install the PDL into your system run:

  make install



=================================================================
                              FFTW
=================================================================
!! You'll need to build *version 2* of the FFTW library for PDL.
!! Version 3 has a new API and is not compatible with this PDL.

  # download the source code if needed, I used wget
  wget http://www.fftw.org/fftw-2.1.5.tar.gz

  # extract the source files
  tar xzf fftw-2.1.5.tar.gz 

  # change to the source directory
  cd fftw-2.1.5/

  # this is the standard GNU build process
  ./configure 
  make
  make check
  make install

The FFTW library built without a hitch and installed in
/usr/local as the default (/usr/local/lib, /usr/local/include,
and /usr/local/info). A clean build of PDL should pick it up.

NOTE: if problems see rebaseall below.
 


=================================================================
                             PGPLOT
=================================================================
NOTE: cygwin 1.7.5 has new include locations so the following
      will not work without changing the various paths!!

1. build the pgplot library and install.

  Download from http://astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot

  # Extract the archive file into a source location, I used ~
  $ tar xzf pgplot5.2.tar.gz 
  $ cd ~/pgplot

  # Make an install directory, this is a typical default location
  $ mkdir /usr/local/pgplot

  $ cp drivers.list /usr/local/pgplot/
  $ cd /usr/local/pgplot
  $ vi drivers.list 
  
  Edit drivers.list to enable the drivers you wish but
  uncommenting desired drivers by removing the leading ! on the
  line. Here are the ones I used (see PDL/cygwin/driver.list):

  $ grep -v '^!' drivers.list
    LXDRIV 0 /LATEX     LaTeX picture environment
    NUDRIV 0 /NULL      Null device (no output)                           Std F77
    PPDRIV 1 /PPM       Portable Pixel Map file, landscape
    PPDRIV 2 /VPPM      Portable PIxel Map file, portrait
    PSDRIV 1 /PS        PostScript printers, monochrome, landscape        Std F77
    PSDRIV 2 /VPS       Postscript printers, monochrome, portrait         Std F77
    PSDRIV 3 /CPS       PostScript printers, color, landscape             Std F77
    PSDRIV 4 /VCPS      PostScript printers, color, portrait              Std F77
    TTDRIV 5 /XTERM     XTERM Tektronix terminal emulator                 Std F77
    WDDRIV 1 /WD        X Window dump file, landscape
    WDDRIV 2 /VWD       X Window dump file, portrait
    XWDRIV 1 /XWINDOW   Workstations running X Window System              C
    XWDRIV 2 /XSERVE    Persistent window on X Window System              C
  
  Edit the sys_cygwin configuration file to work with the
  current version of cygwin. (TBD, update this file and pass on
  to pgplot distribution for inclusion, for now see
  PDL/cygwin/g77_gcc.conf)

  $ vi sys_cygwin/g77_gcc.conf 

  # This diff command shows the lines that need changing
  $ diff g77_gcc.conf*
  12c12
  <    XINCL="-I/usr/X11R6/include"
  ---
  >    XINCL="-I/usr/X11R6.4/include"
  48c48
  <    FFLAGD="-fno-backslash -I/usr/include"
  ---
  >    FFLAGD="-fno-backslash"
  58c58
  <    CFLAGC="-DPG_PPU -O2 -DNOMALLOCH -I. -I/usr/include"
  ---
  >    CFLAGC="-DPG_PPU -O2 -DNOMALLOCH -I."
  75c75
  <    LIBS="-L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -lpng -lz"
  ---
  >    LIBS="-L/usr/X11R6.4/lib -lX11"
  
  $ ~/pgplot/makemake ~/pgplot cygwin
  $ make
  $ make clean
  $ make cpg
  $ PGPLOT_DIR="/usr/local/pgplot/"; export PGPLOT_DIR

  Be sure to add PGPLOT_DIR to your environment and add it to
  your PATH as well. Now we can build the PGPLOT module for
  perl. Download from www.cpan.org if needed.

2. Now install the PGPLOT perl module. This is used by
   PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT.

  $ tar xzf PGPLOT-2.19.tar.gz
  $ cd PGPLOT-2.19

  # Be sure to set the environment!
  $ export PGPLOT_DIR=/usr/local/pgplot
  $ export PATH=$PGPLOT_DIR:$PATH

  $ perl Makefile.PL

  Hand edit the Makefile generated by Makefile.PL and correct
  the link line (TBD: fix the Makefile.PL build process and
  propagate cygwin fixes back to the module author.  Sorry,
  you'll have to edit this one).

  $ vi Makefile
     
  Edit the EXTRALIBS = ... and LDLOADLIBS = ... lines to change
  "-lpgplot -lcpgplot" to "-lcpgplot -lpgplot -lpng -lz" 

  The first part of the modified lines look like this:

  EXTRALIBS = -L/usr/X11R6/lib -L/usr/local/pgplot -lcpgplot -lpgplot -lpng -lz -lX11 ...
  LDLOADLIBS = -L/usr/X11R6/lib -L/usr/local/pgplot -lcpgplot -lpgplot -lpng -lz -lX11 ...

  Build it now:

  $ make

  # Lots of tests!
  $ make test

  $ make install

  pgplot library is installed and working. PGPLOT module is
  installed and working.

3. Build PDL configured to use PGPLOT (in perldl.conf file).
   If your pgplot installation worked, it should be picked up
   automatically.

NOTE: if problems see rebaseall below.



=================================================================
                            REBASEALL
=================================================================
There is a known issue on cygwin where DLLs have to have their
base addresses fixed so that runtime conflicts do not occur.  The
problems occur for the external modules and their interfaces using
DLLs.  Specifically, the DLLs in /usr/lib/perl5 and the DLLs in
the PLplot bin directory at least.  The usual sign for this is
that some tests fail mysteriously.  If you run the failing test
by hand (for example):

  perl -Mblib t/plplot.t

You may see no error but only 1 test run or even a message saying
that the test failed before generating any output.  If so, you'll
need to run rebaseall:

  0. Generate a list of additional DLLs to check:

     find /usr/lib/perl5 /usr/bin /usr/local /pdl_build_dir/blib -iname '*.dll' > /bin/fixit.list

  1. Exit all cygwin processes, windows, shells, X server,...

  2. Start up a windows CMD shell window (Start->Run cmd)

  3. cd to the cygwin /bin directory (cd c:\cygwin\bin by default)

  4. Run ash in that directory (ash)

  5. Run rebaseall (./rebaseall -T fixit.list)

       Note that we created the fixit.list file in the c:\cygwin\bin
       folder to begin with.  If you put it elsewhere, you'll need
       to use the appropriate pathnames.

After the rebaseall command has completed, you should be able to
start up X windows and rerun the failed tests (perl -Mblib t/testname.t)
or all tests (make test).
