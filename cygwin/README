=================================================================
                            Overview
=================================================================
This directory contains supplemental build information to
configure and install PDL on a windows system with the cygwin
toolset (http://www.cygwin.com).

The cygwin library provides the missing unix/posix functionality
to allow unix applications to be more easily ported to windows.
A windows PC with cygwin looks like different flavor of unix.
Since cygwin looks like a unix, [almost] all of the standard
perl functionality works and PDL can build pretty much as it
does on other unix systems.

See the INSTALL file for instructions on building and
installing PDL on cygwin and for notes on building the external
dependencies.

See the PDL/win32 subdirectory for instructions on building a
native windows PDL.


=================================================================
                             WORKING
=================================================================
The cygwin PDL includes all the base PDL functionality          
including bad values support (if configured) as well as the     
following modules which depend on the presence of various       
external dependencies:                                          

 PDL::FFTW
  (Builds if FFTW version 2 has been hand built and installed,
   cygwin only comes with FFTW version 3.  The PDL interface
   is to be updated to v3 support following the PDL 2.4.5 release)

 PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT
  (Builds if pgplot library has been hand built and installed)

 PDL::Graphics::PLplot
  (Builds if plplot library has been hand built and installed)

 PDL::Graphics::TriD
  (Builds automatically if you have X11 and OpenGL + FreeGLUT
  installed).  There is a known problem with PDL::Graphics::TriD::Tk
  and Tk v804.028 where the embedded OpenGL window widget fails
  to be configured.  Running under the debugger makes it work.

 PDL::GSL::*
 PDL::GSLSF::*
  (Builds if GSL is installed via cygwin setup.exe)

 PDL::IO::GD
  (Builds if the gd lib is installed via cygwin setup.exe)

 PDL::GIS::Proj
 PDL::Transform::Proj4
  (Builds if PROJ has been installed via cygwin setup.exe)

 PDL::Slatec
  (Builds if ExtUtils::F77 has been installed)

 PDL::IO::Browser
  (Build may pass if enabled, disabled by default for all OSes)



=================================================================
                           NOT WORKING
=================================================================
These modules with external dependencies are not yet available
for cygwin:

 PDL::Graphics::IIS
  
 PDL::Graphics::Karma   (Karma has not been ported to cygwin)
  
 PDL::IO::HDF           (HDF has not been ported to cygwin)
  
 PDL::IO::NDF           (NDF has not been ported to cygwin)
