** This is experimental code so use at your own risk! **

This directory contains various development efforts for
getting PDL to work with Padre starting with migrating
the existing perldl shell to use Devel::REPL which is
the basis of Padre::Plugin::REPL.

You will need to install the version 1.3.7 of Devel::REPL
in addition to PDL to use this code.


NiceSlice.pm

  Implements PDL::NiceSlice preprocessing for the Devel::REPL
  shell (i.e. Devel::REPL::Plugin::NiceSlice).  One way to
  get a basic shell going is as follows:


  re.pl  # from bash prompt (just re for win32)

  # from repl $ prompt
  do 'NiceSlice.pm';	# make Devel::REPL::Plugin::NiceSlice available
  $_REPL->load_plugin($_) for qw(NiceSlice);
  $_REPL->load_plugin($_) for qw(CompletionDriver::Methods);
  do 'pdlrun';          # make PDL stuff available

  Now you have an interactive shell with history and method
  completion (completion is not available on win32 unless you
  also have Term::ReadLine::Gnu).  By default Devel::REPL always
  prints the result which differs from the perldl default.


pdlrun

  Startup stuff for PDL shell, loads modules and configuration.
