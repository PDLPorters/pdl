	Welcome to a short tour of the capabilities of
	PDL::Graphics::TriD.

	Press 'q' in the graphics window for the next screen.
	Rotate the image by pressing mouse button one and
	dragging in the graphics window.
	Zoom in/out by pressing MB3 and drag up/down.
	Note that a standalone TriD script must start with

		use PDL;
		use PDL::Graphics::TriD;

	to work properly.
