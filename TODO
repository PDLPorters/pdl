What follows is that task list and description of
the work planned for the future  PDL-2.4.x releases.

The main goal we are working towards is to have a
baseline PDL working on *all* PDL OS platforms:
win32/cygwin, macosx, and linux/unix/bsd systems with
support for 2-D graphics (via PLplot) and 3-D graphics
(via OpenGL/TriD).


+-------------------------------------------------------+
|      Candidate Tasks for PDL-2.4.x Development        |
+-------------------------------------------------------+

   This section documents the top level tasks from
   the more detailed list below.  The first column
   of the line indicates the priority of that item
   (and those below it) for the PDL-2.4.x release:

     T -- TBD
     R -- required for release to occur
     N -- nice to have but not mandatory
     no mark means same as super bullet or FYI
     D -- done

  Each item has some task description based on the
  current status.

T  Update task list after PDL-2.4.8 release.

|                       TESTING                         |
+-------------------------------------------------------+

   Need to test PDL build from scratch
   * Unix/Linux/BSD
   * Windows/cygwin
   * Mac OS X
   

   Verify dependency detection across all major PDL platforms
   * Unix/Linux/BSD, Windows/Cygwin, Mac OS X
   * Check completely clean build each platform
   * Confirm that dependencies for each platform
       are correctly detected and reported.
   * Add any issues to Known_problems


   Add support for Known_problems to tests
   * Implemented via the Test::More TODO {} block feature
   * Ignores FAIL for tests flagged as TODO
   * All bug reports should have a test in PDL/t


   Clean up and triage for tickets prior to release.
   * Bugs
   * Feature requests
   * Patches



+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                    DEPENDENCIES                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
   
   Alien modules for the external PDL dependencies
   * Alien::PLplot
   * Alien::PROJ4

     This is the first step to get PDL::Graphics::PLplot
     working cross-platform: be able to have the PLplot
     lib checked for or even installed as a dependency.
     Work based on the approach in Alien::SDL might be a
     good starting point.


   Define standard paths for external dependency libraries for PDL
   * Local to PDL (not system-wide)
   * Can skip install if system-wide is available
   * Relocatable with package-config or Alien info
   * Document any PDL-specific install locations

   
   List and obtain module owners and developers for existing PDL modules
   * Revisit each module's status by platform
     * Regarding portability
     * Review external dependency handling
     * Update plan for development


   Fix/document FORTRAN code requirements
   * Add a USE_FORTRAN option to perldl.conf
   * Add check for ExtUtils:F77
   * Convert PDL::Slatec to use C with f2c of source
   * Convert PDL::Minuit to use C with f2c of source 
   


+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                    DOCUMENTATION                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
   
   Update PDL web site pages 
   

   Review current documentation (underway)
   * Verify correctness and consistency with PDL-2.4.8+
   * Update documentation where needed.
   * Add web searchable versions of the docs.
   * Maybe a wiki format could be used to improve docs 


   Add/update platform install notes to PDL wiki
   * Complete build-from-scratch installs
   * Soup to nuts via the cpan shell
   * Build issues and their fixes
   * How to get needed dependencies
   * Other platform details
     * Mac OS X
     * Linux (by distribution and version)
     * BSD
     * Solaris
     * Windows
     * Cygwin
     * Other 


   Add CPAN shell start-up info to PDL wiki or web page
   * Basic cpan
   * CPANminus
   * Others

     Recent list queries and new user discussions
     suggest that we need to revisit the beginner
     documentation for how to get started with PDL.
     We definitely need clear instructions for how
     to start from scratch with cpan to install
     PDL (verify on all PDL platforms).


   Add CPAN Testers start up info to PDL wiki
   * Test::Reporter
   * CPAN Testers version 2
   * Easy/basic install and usage

     The new CPAN Testers version 2.0 has been
     released.  It uses a web-based interface to
     send reports rather than email.  As a result
     is is much easier to configure than the old
     interface.  As such, we would get better PDL
     feedback if we have a quick-start for that.

     Add info for PERL_CPAN_REPORTER_DIR variable.


   Document how to set up a local sandbox for PDL build
   * PREFIX and LIB for ExtUtils::MakeMaker
   * Build with CPAN shell 
   * Check out brewperl

     A number of PDL users are configuring their
     own local library, perl, and PDL installations.
     It would be nice if clear directions were
     written down so everyone doesn't have to
     reinvent the same wheel.


   Add docs/support for users of other software
   * IDL, Matlab, NumPy
   * Add help for equivalent PDL constructs
   

   Update PDL Book (in progress)
   * Needs updating to match PDL-2.4.8 from PDL-2.4.3
   * make a web version available on-line if possible
   
     Matt Kenworthy has been working on web-izing
     the previous manuscript based on Tex/LaTeX.


   Better document the PDL help system
   * Requirements and usage
   * Quick start
   * Add custom/user key word search support
   * Is there a way to fetch all the functions/keywords
       the PDL help system supports?

|                      USABILITY                        |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
   
   Improve PDL usability for first time users
   * Work out of the box via cpan shell
     * Fully automatic
     * Semi-manual
   * Easy install via 1-click or package managers 
   * PAR for distribution

     A simple cpan or platform package install should
     work out of the box.  Maybe not all dependencies
     will build but PDL should build with 2D and 3D
     graphics support for most/all platforms.


   Implement "1-click" installs by platform and document in wiki
   * Mac OS X: SciKarl, verify support by OS versions
   * Windows: Strawberry Perl Professional, ActivePerl
   * Unix OSes: Various package managers
   
T  Clean up build output from make process to reduce cruft
   * Collect build output into build log file by default
   * Add an output filter to the text collected from the
       CPAN build process.  (e.g. Text::Filter et al)

|                    INSTALLATION                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
   
   Fix the test problems with preexisting PDL installs
   * Develop test methodology
   * Add PDL::Core::Dev utility to perform check
   * Automate detection/test skip if not build logic

   
   Check/set perldl.conf options before the build
   * Interactive option view prompt() in Makefile.PL
   * GUI version

     * Handle cut and paste of printed piddles
     * Better error checking for invalid values
