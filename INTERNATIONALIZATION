TODO

PDL currently does not have internationalization support for
its error messages although perl itself does support i18n
and locales.  Some of the tests for names and strings are
specific to ASCII and English.  Please report any issues
regarding internationalization to the perldl mailing lists.

Of course, volunteers to implement this or help with the
translations would be welcome.  We need to see how other
perl modules handle this.
