*DECK EZFFTI
      SUBROUTINE EZFFTI (N, WSAVE, IFAC)
C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  EZFFTI
C***PURPOSE  Initialize a work array for EZFFTF and EZFFTB.
C***LIBRARY   SLATEC (FFTPACK)
C***CATEGORY  J1A1
C***TYPE      SINGLE PRECISION (EZFFTI-S)
C***KEYWORDS  FFTPACK, FOURIER TRANSFORM
C***AUTHOR  Swarztrauber, P. N., (NCAR)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  Subroutine EZFFTI initializes the work array WSAVE which is used in
C  both EZFFTF and EZFFTB.  The prime factorization of N together with
C  a tabulation of the trigonometric functions are computed and
C  stored in WSAVE.
C
C  Input Parameter
C
C  N       the length of the sequence to be transformed.
C
C  Output Parameter
C
C  WSAVE   a work array which must be dimensioned at least 3*N.
C          The same work array can be used for both EZFFTF and EZFFTB
C          as long as N remains unchanged.  Different WSAVE arrays
C          are required for different values of N.
C
C  IFAC    integer array which must be dimensioned at least 15
