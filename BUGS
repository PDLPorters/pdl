REPORTING BUGS
--------------

Please submit bug reports via the sourceforge bug tracker
interface at

   http://sourceforge.net/p/pdl/bugs/

where you can review the previously submitted bug reports.
Click on "Create Ticket" to generate a bug report.  If you do not
already have a sourceforge.net account, you will need to
get one to submit the report:

   http://sourceforge.net/account/registration/

Please provide a way for the PDL developers to contact you
regarding the problem.

Try to include any information you think might help someone
isolate, reproduce, and fix your problem.

At a *minimum*, include the following information:

    * PDL version number (e.g. PDL-2.4.7)

    * Perl version information
      (output from "perl -v" or "perl -V", even better!)

    * Operating System
      (run the "uname -a" command on many unix systems)

    * If you are reporting a bug with an installed PDL,
      please include the full output of "perldl -V"

      If the PDL has compiled and built but not been
      installed, you may run "perl -Mblib perldl -V"
      from the top level of the PDL build directory.

    * The bug description and how to reproduce it.
      Short examples using the PDL shell, pdl2 (or
      perldl), are excellent!


Other things that are often helpful:

    * Details about your operating environment
      that might be related to the problem

    * Exact cut and pasted error or warning messages

    * The shortest, clearest code you can manage
      to write which reproduces the bug described.

    * A patch against the latest released version
      of this distribution which fixes this bug.


Alternatively, send an e-mail report with the above
information (including the output of 'perldl -V')
to pdl-porters@jach.hawaii.edu . See

   http://pdl.perl.org/?page=mailing-lists

for info on how to subscribe to this list.



BEFORE YOU SEND A REPORT
------------------------

BEFORE you report a bug make sure you got the latest
release version of PDL (always available from CPAN,
check http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=PDL). Also
check the FAQ (http://pdl.perl.org/?docs=FAQ&title=PDL::FAQ) and
the mailing list archives for hints. You can find
links to the searchable archives at

   http://pdl.perl.org/?page=mailing-lists



PATCHES
-------

Patches can be sent to the pdl-porters mailing list
(see above) or can be directly submitted to the
patch manager

   http://sourceforge.net/p/pdl/patches/

Patches should be made against the latest released
PDL or, ideally, against the current git sources
which you can browse and check out at

   git://git.code.sf.net/p/pdl/code


Thanks,
The pdl-porters team.
