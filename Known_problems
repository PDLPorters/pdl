The following issues have been reported with this version of PDL:


- Multiple subtest failures in t/gd_oo_tests.t have been
  seen in CPAN Testers reports.


- A change in perl-5.14 on how the 'x' operator works affects
  PDL's overload of that operator for matrix multiplication.
  An example that shows the problem is code like:

     f( ($pdl0 * $pdl1) x $pdl2 )

  which gives an error.  The fix is to force the element-wise
  operation in parentheses to be treated in scalar context
  rather than list context.  E.g.,

    f( scalar($p0 * $p1) x $p2 );

  Please see
  http://mailman.jach.hawaii.edu/pipermail//pdl-porters/2012-February/004426.html
  for a more detailed discussion and additional alternative
  work-arounds.


- On MS Windows, perl 5.14 (and perhaps later), it is reported that
  PDL::Graphics::PLplot cannot be sucessfully built as part of the
  PDL build. It compiles ok, but the resultant binary files are
  unusable. Workaround is to build PDL first, then build
  PDL::Graphics::PLplot separately.


- The current Ctrl-C logic in the PDL shells (pdl2 and perldl)
  don't work the same with the perl's new "safe signals".  A
  workaround to the problem is to set the PERL_SIGNALS environment
  variable to "unsafe".  See sf.net feature request #3308168
  for details and any future status.


- The PDL build process checks for white space in the build
  directory as that is known to cause problems for some modules
  and asks you if you wish to continue [default is yes].

  NOTE: You can avoid the interactive prompts by setting the
  environment variable PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT to true (e.g., 1).


- The Perl debugger for perls 5.10.1 through 5.14.x has a new
  "feature" leading to false fails for lvalue subroutines when
  run under the debugger.  If you need to debug such code with
  an affected perl version, the work around is to use an
  intermediate temporary variable assignment as in:

    $piddle->slice('0:10') .= 100;           # original slice code
    ($tmp = $piddle->slice('0:10')) .= 100;  # work around perl -d "feature"

  The problem is understood and it appears that the error has
  been replaced by a warning for perl-5.15.1.  NOTE: the work-
  around is 100% effective---but ugly.


- Changes in perl-5.16.x break some existing PDL usage of lvalue
  subs for this release.  It is planned to incorporate the needed
  fixes in the next PDL release.  See the perldl mailing list
  for status updates and other announcements.


- Multiline q'' constructs in the pdl2 shell now work correctly
  but you'll need to avoid using the q abbreviation for quit
  in pdl2 (at least until the multi-line plugin in Devel::REPL
  can be updated appropriately).  If you do get "stuck" in a q
  quit attempt, just type Ctrl-D to exit the shell.


- The demo 3d and 3d2 windows do not close (can not be closed)
  after the demo finishes.  You need to exit the perldl shell
  to have the window close.


- When you close a TriD graphics window with the frame widget
  the whole process exits including the perldl shell.


- PDL::FFTW is based on version 2 of the FFTW API.  The current
  release of the FFTW library is version 3.2.2.  To use PDL::FFTW
  you will need to install FFTW version 2.1.5, use the built-in
  PDL::FFT routines instead, or (better yet) submit a patch to
  update PDL::FFTW to the version 3 API.


- Extremely verbose but not particularly helpful text output from
  the configure-build-test process.


- Directory completion in the interactive PDL shells (perldl and pdl2)
  using Term::ReadLine::Perl adds a space after each directory expansion.
  To continue to complete, one must delete the space before typing <TAB>
  again.  The problem has been reported as a Term::ReadLine::Perl bug.


- PDL on Cygwin has (by default) a 300MB process memory limit which can
  cause out of memory crashes with large data sets.  See the cygwin users
  guide: http://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-maxmem.html for how
  to increase the memory limit.


- minimum/maximum/min/max inconsistently handle NaN values.
  NaNs for the first element of a pdl will propagate to the
  result while if the first element is a number, then the
  result will be a number.  The answer for max/min should not
  depend on the order of the input values.


- 16-bit image IO via rpic/wpic and rim/wim do not correctly
  handle byte order issues.  The intermediate PNM data piped
  through the converter programs is not adjusted to network
  byte order per the NetPBM convention/standard.  This is not
  an issue for big-endian systems or for 8-bit/channel image
  data.
