The following issues have been reported with this version of PDL:

- A bug in Netpbm from versions 10.56.00 through 10.61.2 may
  result in a an invalid conversion of RAST images to PNM
  format on some platforms, resulting in a failed picrgb test.

  
- Bugs in Netpbm versions earlier than 10.58.00 result in
  invalid 16bit PNG image IO and failing tests.


- GLUT readline support in perldl with the -glut option not
  yet implemented for win32.  Work in progress.


- A change in perl-5.14 on how the 'x' operator works affects
  PDL's overload of that operator for matrix multiplication.
  This can affect code using parentheses to group.  An example
  that shows the problem is code like:

     f( ($pdl0 * $pdl1) x $pdl2 )

  which now gives an error.  The fix is to force the element-wise
  operation in parentheses to be treated in scalar context rather
  than list context.  E.g.,

    f( scalar($p0 * $p1) x $p2 );

  Please see
  http://mailman.jach.hawaii.edu/pipermail//pdl-porters/2012-February/004426.html
  for a more detailed discussion and additional work-arounds.


- On MS Windows, perl 5.14 (and perhaps later), it is reported that
  PDL::Graphics::PLplot cannot be sucessfully built as part of the
  PDL build. It compiles ok, but the resultant binary files are
  unusable. Workaround is to build PDL first, then build
  PDL::Graphics::PLplot separately.


- Some versions of MinGW gcc (used to compile for win32 perls)
  crash in compilation of large, PP-generated files.  The work-
  around is to disable optimization for those file.  See the
  INSTALL file for a hand fix.


- The current Ctrl-C logic in the PDL shells (pdl2 and perldl)
  doesn't work the same with the perl's new "safe signals".  A
  workaround to the problem is to set the PERL_SIGNALS environment
  variable to "unsafe".  See sf.net feature request #3308168
  for details and any future status.


- The Perl debugger for perls 5.10.1 through 5.14.x has a new
  "feature" leading to false fails for lvalue subroutines when
  run under the debugger.  If you need to debug such code with
  an affected perl version, the work around is to use an
  intermediate temporary variable assignment as in:

    $piddle->slice('0:10') .= 100;           # original slice code
    ($tmp = $piddle->slice('0:10')) .= 100;  # work around perl -d "feature"

  The problem is understood and it appears that the error has
  been replaced by a warning with perl-5.15.1 and is fixed in
  perl-5.16.0.  NOTE: the work-around is ugly but effective.


- Multiline q'' constructs are broken in the Devel::REPL versions
  1.003012 and 1.003013 so you'll need to use perldl or avoid
  splitting quoted strings across lines.  A fix is being investigated.


- The demo 3d and 3d2 windows do not close (can not be closed)
  after the demo finishes.  You need to exit the perldl shell
  to have the window close.


- When you close a TriD graphics window with the frame widget
  the whole process exits including the perldl shell.


- PDL::FFTW is based on version 2 of the FFTW API.  The current
  release of the FFTW library is version 3.2.2.  To use PDL::FFTW
  you will need to install FFTW version 2.1.5, use the built-in
  PDL::FFT routines instead, or (better yet) submit a patch to
  update PDL::FFTW to the version 3 API.


- Extremely verbose but not particularly helpful text output from
  the configure-build-test process.


- Directory completion in the interactive PDL shells (perldl and pdl2)
  using Term::ReadLine::Perl adds a space after each directory expansion.
  To continue to complete, one must delete the space before typing <TAB>
  again.  The problem has been reported as a Term::ReadLine::Perl bug.


- PDL on Cygwin has (by default) a 300MB process memory limit which can
  cause out of memory crashes with large data sets.  See the cygwin users
  guide: http://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-maxmem.html for how
  to increase the memory limit.


- minimum/maximum/min/max inconsistently handle NaN values.
  NaNs for the first element of a pdl will propagate to the
  result while if the first element is a number, then the
  result will be a number.  The answer for max/min should not
  depend on the order of the input values.


- The following SourceForge bugs are outstanding at time of the
  PDL-2.004_996 release:

  3606774    PDL re-install wipes out non-core docs
  3605814    PDL::Demos system needs overhaul
  3605476    Several core modules do not have man pages
  3602817    PDL::Index does not render on websites
  3601064    Need INSTALLSITEBIN for recent Macports Perls
  3599516    plplot.t failure when building 2.4.11
  3570236    clip() edge case not handled right
  3570235    Wrong results in corner empty-set cases
  3543056    propagate badflag with .=
  3539685    pdldoc can't handle SPP mount location change
  3518190    t/gd_oo_tests.t fails for AMD64

               A candidate fix is in the current relese but
               the tests are skipped by default if the
               AUTOMATED_TESTING environment variable is set.
               If you have an AMD64 platform, please let us
               know if the test passes "by hand".  Thanks.
               
  3515759    PDL::GIS::Proj doesn't buidl with proj-4.8.0

               A partial work around is in place.  Please
               report any on-going problems.

  3509400    pp_def, pp_line_numbers,..not found by pdldoc
  3316394    'help funname' fails to show multiple function names
  3314708    PDL install does not install scantree.pl
  3299615    PLplot still unusable with X
  3234141    max() fails on nan
  3161459    online docs don't link to functions in other PDL modules
  3018731    NiceSlice affects code where it should not
  2995500    perl -d chokes on lvalue functions

               Fixed in perl 5.16.x or use work around.

  2153898    default PDL build output too long
  1507054    closing TriD window kills perldl shell
