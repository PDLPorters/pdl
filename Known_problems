The following issues have been reported with this version of PDL:


- The default TriD controls are based on having at least
  a two button mouse.  For Macs with one button, you can use
  Ctrl+Click to generate the Right-click.  It is also possible
  to configure the Macbook tracpad to generate a secondary
  click---see the control panel.


- VRML output driver does not work for PDL::Graphics::TriD


- When you close a TriD graphics window with the frame widget
  the whole process exits which is annoying if you are running
  in perldl.  Patches to the exit handler a la test.pl welcome!


- There is an depth/overlay artifact with axis labels on at least
  on Mac OS system where the 3D plots are fine but the text for
  the labels appear on top of everything---as if it were in an
  overlay mode.  We're looking for folks with the problem to help
  with diagnosis and fix.  RSVP to the perldl mailing list.


- The default TriD build settings for PDL are WITH_3D => undef,
  and USE_POGL => 1 which implies an install of OpenGL. On x86
  windows systems, an install of a 64bit FreeGLUT library is
  required and you'll need to install that by hand since OpenGL-0.60
  does not include the required library.  Setting USE_POGL => 0
  or undef should allow PDL-2.4.5 to be built/installed but you
  will probably not have TriD graphics until the FreeGLUT DLL
  issue is resolved.  See win32/ directory READMEs for more info.


- FFTW 3.2.2 is the current release version of the FFTW library
  but is not yet supported by PDL::FFTW.  You may install version
  2.1.5 of FFTW which is supported, fall back to using the PDL's
  built-in fft routines (PDL::FFT), or submit a patch to update
  PDL::FFTW to the version 3 API. 


- Various make problems with build:

  - Using parallel make causes the build to fail so don't use -j # options.

  - Make fails with message like

      "*** No rule to make target `pptemplate', needed by `pptemplate.pod'.  Stop."

      If you have this error, please contact the PDL developers via the perldl
      mailing list and help us track this one down.  Thanks!


- Extremely verbose but not particularly helpful text output
  from configure, built, test process.


- Lvalue subroutine errors have been reported for perl 5.6.2
  installation on a linux 2.4 kernel system.  Perl versions 5.8
  and above are *really* recommended.


- PDL::IO::Dumper has test failures on some systems that appear
  to result from an incorrectly detected/use flavor of uuencode
  or uudecode.  Installing Convert::UU should resolve the problem.


- PDL configuration failures have come about because needed temp
  files can not be created.  This appears to be a result of platform
  misconfiguration of TEMPDIR and not PDL per se.


- 16bit image file IO fails in t/pic_16bit.t apparently due to
  an older version of NetPBM which does not support the raw 16bit
  formats.  If this test fails, try upgrading your NetPBM library.


- Documentation for the various convolution routines are unclear.
  They need to be expanded with the mathematics of what is
  actually being computed.


- The following SourceForge bugs are outstanding at time of the
  PDL-2.4.5_005 release:

  2339818    need lib64 searches in Graphics::TriD  
  2153898    default PDL build output too long

  1994584    PDL Has no signed 8-bit integer datatype
  1994442    imagrgb problems
  1582350    badflag called in PDL::Core and PDL::Complex
  1505171    failure in MatrixOps::eigens in CVS
  1435189    Installation with cpan2rpm
  1205359    PGPLOT Window does not store full state info
  1059020    Problem with FFTW version 3.0.1
