The following issues have been reported with this version of PDL:


- The default TriD controls are based on having 2+ button mouse.

  For Macs with one button, you can use Ctrl+Click to generate
  the needed Right-click.  It is also possible to configure the
  Macbook tracpad to generate a secondary click via the control panel.


- VRML output driver does not work for PDL::Graphics::TriD


- When you close a TriD graphics window with the frame widget
  the whole process exits including the perldl shell.


- A depth/overlay artifact with axis labels on one Mac OS system
  has been reported.  The 3D plot is fine but the label text appear
  on top of everything and not along the axes.


- FFTW 3.2.2 is the current release version of the FFTW library
  but is not yet supported by PDL::FFTW.  You may install version
  2.1.5 of FFTW which is supported, use PDL's built-in FFT
  routines (see PDL::FFT), or submit a patch to update PDL::FFTW
  to the version 3 API. 


- Various make problems with build:

  - Using parallel make causes the build to fail so don't use -j # options.
  - Make fails with message like.
      "*** No rule to make target `pptemplate', needed by `pptemplate.pod'.  Stop."
    The cause is unknown.  If you have this problem, please let the developers
    know via the perldl mailing list.


- Extremely verbose but not particularly helpful text output
  from the configure-build-test process.


- Lvalue subroutine errors have been reported for perl 5.6.2
  installation on a linux 2.4 kernel system.  Perl versions 5.8
  and above are *really* recommended.


- PDL::IO::Dumper has test failures on some systems that appear
  to result from an incorrectly detected/use flavor of uuencode
  or uudecode.  Installing Convert::UU should resolve the problem.


- PDL configuration failures have come about because needed temp
  files can not be created.  This appears to be a result of platform
  misconfiguration of TEMPDIR and not PDL per se.


- 16bit image file IO fails in t/pic_16bit.t apparently due to
  an older version of NetPBM which does not support the raw 16bit
  formats.  If this test fails, try upgrading your NetPBM library.


- PDL on Cygwin has a 300MB process memory limit which can
  cause out of memory crashes with large data sets.


- The following SourceForge bugs are outstanding at time of the
  PDL-2.4.6 release:

  2901814    Arrow keys don't work in perldl on win32 console
  2901810    Ctrl-C kills perldl in win32 console
