The following issues have been reported with this version of PDL:


- The default TriD controls are based on having at least
  a two button mouse.  For Macs with one button, you can use
  Ctrl+Click to generate the Right-click.  It is also possible
  to configure the Macbook tracpad to generate a secondary
  click---see the control panel.


- VRML output driver does not work for PDL::Graphics::TriD


- When you close a TriD graphics window with the frame widget
  the whole process exits which is annoying if you are running
  in perldl.  Patches to the exit handler a la test.pl welcome!


- There is an depth/overlay artifact with axis labels on at least
  on Mac OS system where the 3D plots are fine but the text for
  the labels appear on top of everything---as if it were in an
  overlay mode.  We're looking for folks with the problem to help
  with diagnosis and fix.  RSVP to the perldl mailing list.


- The default TriD build settings for PDL are WITH_3D => undef,
  and USE_POGL => 1 which implies an install of OpenGL. On x86
  windows systems, an install of a 64bit FreeGLUT library is
  required and you'll need to install that by hand since OpenGL-0.60
  does not include the required library.  Setting USE_POGL => 0
  or undef should allow PDL-2.4.5 to be built/installed but you
  will probably not have TriD graphics until the FreeGLUT DLL
  issue is resolved.  See win32/ directory READMEs for more info.


- FFTW 3.2.2 is the current release version of the FFTW library
  but is not yet supported by PDL::FFTW.  You may install version
  2.1.5 of FFTW which is supported, fall back to using the PDL's
  built-in fft routines (PDL::FFT), or submit a patch to update
  PDL::FFTW to the version 3 API. 


- Various make problems with build:

  - Using parallel make causes the build to fail so don't use -j # options.

  - Make fails with message like

      "*** No rule to make target `pptemplate', needed by `pptemplate.pod'.  Stop."

      If you have this error, please contact the PDL developers via the perldl
      mailing list and help us track this one down.  Thanks!


- Extremely verbose but not particularly helpful text output
  from configure, built, test process.


- Lvalue subroutine errors have been reported for perl 5.6.2
  installation on a linux 2.4 kernel system.  Perl versions 5.8
  and above are *really* recommended.


- PDL::IO::Dumper has test failures on some systems that appear
  to result from an incorrectly detected/use flavor of uuencode
  or uudecode.  Installing Convert::UU should resolve the problem.


- PDL configuration failures have come about because needed temp
  files can not be created.  This appears to be a result of platform
  misconfiguration of TEMPDIR and not PDL per se.


- 16bit image file IO fails in t/pic_16bit.t apparently due to
  an older version of NetPBM which does not support the raw 16bit
  formats.  If this test fails, try upgrading your NetPBM library.


- Documentation for the various convolution routines are unclear.
  The implementation assumes that the kernel argument is flipped
  and then calculates the correlation of that with the image.  This
  makes no difference for symmetric kernels but can give unexpected
  results with non-symmetric ones or if you are trying to do your
  own correlation.


- fftconvolve does not give the same results as the brute force
  summation calculation, see discussion for SF bug # 2630369.


- The following SourceForge bugs are outstanding at time of the
  PDL-2.4.5 release:

  2630369    PDL::FFT::fftconvolve - bad scaling?  
  2524068    Build breaks for PDL-2.4.4/Lib/Minuit (code not ISO C)
