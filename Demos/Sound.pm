This demo requires an external command to play the sound,
unfortunately no suitable candidate could be found.
The following players are supported:
 - 'aplay' (from the ALSA suite) comes with the package 'alsa-utils' 
   on Linux
 - 'play' and 'sox' (from SoX) are available as package 'sox' on Linux,
   and can be obtained from https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/
   for Microsoft Windows and MacOS.

=head1 NAME

PDL::Demos::Sound - play PDL-generated sounds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is intended to be auto-discovered by the mechanisms of
L<PDL::Demos>.  That module also defines our interface.

The demo creates some simple sound waves (a scale and a chord) and
pipes them to an external sound player program.  It knows how to
invoke C<aplay> (from alsa-utils), C<play> and C<sox> (the latter two
from SoX - Sound eXchange).  All of these are available as packages in
Linux distributions, SoX is also available from
L<https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/> for Microsoft Windows and
MacOS.

If no suitable player is discovered, the demo does not die but shows
an explanation where to obtain them.
