    Your version of PDL has been compiled without support for bad
    values, hence this demo doesn't do anything.

comment q|
    Welcome to this tour of the bad value support in PDL

    Each piddle contains a flag - accessible via the badflag() method - 
    which indicates whether:

       the piddle contains no bad values (flag equals 0)
       the piddle *MAY* contain bad values (flag equals 1)

    If the flag is set, then the routines (well, those that have been
    converted) will process these bad values correctly, otherwise they 
    are ignored. 

    The code has been written so as to provide as little overhead as
    possible; therefore there should be almost no difference in the
    time it takes to process piddles which do not have their bad flag 
    set.

    # There are 2 ways to see whether bad-value support has been
    # compiled into your perldl:
    print("You can use bad values.\n") if $PDL::Bad::Status;

    # or
    use PDL::Config;
    print("You can stil use bad values.\n") if $PDL::Config{WITH_BADVAL};

    # note that PDL::Bad is included by default when you use 
    # 'use PDL', 'use PDL::Lite', or 'use PDL::LiteF'

    $a = byte(1,2,3);

    # set bad flag, even though all the data is good
    $a->badflag(1);
    print( "Bad flag (a) == ", $a->badflag(), "\n" );

    # note the bad flag is infectious
    $b = 2 * $a;
    print( "Bad flag (b) == ", $b->badflag(), "\n\n" );

    # comparison operators (e.g. all and any) when ALL elements are bad.

    # Currently, the bad value is returned; however most code will not
    # be aware of this and just see it as a true or false value (depending
    # on the numerical value used to store bad values).

    # There is also the fact that the bad value need not relate to the
    # type of the input piddle (due to internal conversion to an 'int +').

comment q|
    Many of the 'core' routines have been converted to handle bad values.
    However, some (including most of the additional modules) have not,
    either because it does not make sense or its too much work to do! 

    To find out the status of a particular routine, use the 'badinfo'
    command in perldl (this information is also included when you do
    'help'), or the '-b' switch of pdldoc.
