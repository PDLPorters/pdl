PDL -- the package
------------------

The Perl Data Language (PerlDL) project aims to turn perl into an efficient
numerical language for scientific computing. The PDL module gives standard
perl the ability to COMPACTLY store and SPEEDILY manipulate the large
N-dimensional data sets which are the bread and butter of scientific computing.
e.g. $a=$b+$c can add two 2048x2048 images in only a fraction of a second.

The aim is to provide tons of useful functionality for scientific and
numeric analysis.

Check the pdl web site at http://pdl.perl.org for more information.


Installation
------------

Please read the file INSTALL for detailed information on how
to configure and install PDL.

Once you have built PDL and either installed it or done
'make doctest', try either

	perl -Mblib perldl

from within the root of the PDL tree or just

	perldl
	
if you have installed PDL already ('make install') to get the
interactive PDL shell. In this shell, 'help' gives you
access to PDL documentation for each function separately ('help
help' for more about this) and 'demo' gives you some basic
examples of what you can do.


Bug Reports
-----------

You can check the existing PDL bugs on sourceforge at

	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=612&atid=100612

The mailing list archives can be searched/read at

	http://mailman.jach.hawaii.edu/pipermail/perldl/
	http://mailman.jach.hawaii.edu/pipermail/pdl-porters/

Questions about problems and possible bugs can be discussed
via the perldl mailing list.  This is very useful if you are
not sure what you have is a bug or not.  For example, the list
is the place to go for install problems.

If you need to post a problem report, please use the
sourceforge.net bug tracker system following the guidance
in the BUGS file:

	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=612&atid=100612

	     which makes PDL even more useful

Comments are welcome - so are volunteers to write code and documentation!
