Release Notes for PDL 2.006_02 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Another quick CPAN developers release

   - This is another release for users and developers
     to have early evaluation and testing with the new
     64bit-index-support branch.  The current plan is
     to merge into PDL git master this weekend.

   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

   - All tests may not pass, especially ones corresponding
     to issues in Known_problems.
   
   - Manual build/install is recommended although the
     cpan shell may be used by specifying the distribution
     path rather than just the module name, e.g.:

       cpan> get  CHM/PDL-2.006_02.tar.gz
       cpan> make CHM/PDL-2.006_02.tar.gz
       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.006_02.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.006_02.tar.gz

Highlights:

 * Make PDL_Index a new type (PDL_N or PDL_IND) and various
   fixes to get things to work.



Release Notes for PDL 2.006_01 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Make new 64bit index support PDL available for more
   widespread testing and evaluation.

 * Another quick CPAN developers release
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

   - All tests may not pass, especially ones corresponding
     to issues in Known_problems.

     cpan shell may be used by specifying the distribution
     path rather than just the module name, e.g.:

       cpan> get  CHM/PDL-2.006_01.tar.gz
       cpan> make CHM/PDL-2.006_01.tar.gz
       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.006_01.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.006_01.tar.gz

Highlights:

 * By default, this release will build PDL with the new
   PDL_Index support and that type will be determined by
   the type of IV for your perl.  If $Config{ivsize}==8
   then you have 64bit indexing.

 * By default, the perldl.conf does not build modules
   requiring external dependencies.



Release Notes for PDL 2.006 --------------------------

 +---------------------------------------------------------------+
 | BE WARNED:  This release includes an update to the internal,  |
 | C-level PDL API for PDL versions 2.4.10 and earlier.  This    |
 | will require that you re-build any PP or XS modules.  Do not  |
 | upgrade or install over an existing PDL installation unless   |
 | you are prepared to do so!!!                                  |
 +---------------------------------------------------------------+

General Notes:

 * Change to the version number scheme used for PDL
   from the dotted-integers format back to plain old
   decimal numbers.

   Unfortunately, PDL has used both alternatives before
   and in an inconsistent, out-of-order way.  With this
   release, the current version will also be the most
   recent version with respect to both numbering schemes.
   
   For more details see David Goldens blob post on
   the topic and the pdl-porters list discussion:

     http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/369/version-numbers-should-be-boring/
     http://mailman.jach.hawaii.edu/pipermail//pdl-porters/2013-February/005343.html
 

 * PDL-2.006 also showcases the demos of two new PDL graphics
   modules in the perldl/pdl2 shells:
   
    - PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot
      http://search.cpan.org/~zowie/PDL-Graphics-Gnuplot-1.4/

    - PDL::Graphics::Prima
      http://search.cpan.org/~dcmertens/PDL-Graphics-Prima-0.13/

   Both modules install on all supported PDL platforms.  A
   recent addition is PDL::Graphics::Simple which provides
   a uniform presentation to the variety off available PDL
   plot/view/print options.
   
    - PDL::Graphics::Simple
      http://search.cpan.org/~zowie/PDL-Graphics-Simple-1.004/README.pod
      
   Let us know how they work for you.  As they are 
   relatively "young" contributions your feedback and
   questions are always welcome.


 * PDL Distribution related updates:

    - Fixes a build issue for PDL at ASPerl
    
    - Many fixes for debian distributions.
    
    - PDL::IO::NDF has been moved to its own
      distribution on CPAN.  This could affect
      upgrades from older PDL installs.
 

Highlights:

 * New support for reading IDL format files via PDL::IO::IDL.

 * Added an unpdl method which is (roughly) the inverse
   operation of pdl (Joel Berger).

 * Updated polyfill and polyfillv routines to the algorithm
   from pnpoly: more accurate on edge pixels and faster due
   to its PP implementation (Tim Haines).

 * Added Boundary=>'Replicate' option to conv2d and med2d (chm).

 * Support for new additional random number generators to
   PDL::GSL (John Lapeyre).

 * Add lgamma support for MinGW-built perls with tests
   to match (sisyphus).

 * Many improvments to docs and their generation from
   PDL sources.  Specific new functionality support:

    - Newly refactored docs engine using core perl
      modules rather than PDL-only ones (Joel Berger)

    - New FullDoc key added to PDL::PP makes writing CPAN
      friendly .pd files much, much easier (David Mertens).

    - New PDL::Doc::add_module() routine to add an external
      module's POD (with PDL::Doc conventions) to the PDL
      docs on-line database (Craig DeForest).

 * Many bugs fixed, some even before a ticket could be opened!

    - Sf.net bug #3607936: Fixed a bug causing crashes
      due to using inplace with a duplicate argument.

    - Sf.net bug #3603249: AutoLoader leaks $_ into local
      context, reported and fixed by Craig.

    - Sf.net bug #3588182: Fixed hist() handling of the case
      of fractional steps in integral input data types.

    - Sf.net bug #3563903: Fixed bug in PNG format detection
      on win32 platforms.  

    - Sf.net bug #3544682: Fixed error report bug in perldl
      that resulted from a change in the way perl handles
      eval exception reporting.

    - Sf.net bug #3539760: qsort[vec] are now inplace aware.

    - Sf.net bug #3518190: Potential fix for t/gd_oo_tests.t
      test crashes.

    - Sf.net bug #3515759: Work around for PDL::GIS::Proj
      build failures with proj-4.8.0.

    - Sf.net bug #3479009: Fixed dummy() to generate a
      valid syntax for the underlying call to slice().

    - Sf.net bug #3475075: Fixed 16-bit PNM raw format handling.

    - Added warning if conv1d is used on a piddle with
      the badflag set.

    - Fix NaN sign issues as reported (and fixed!) by
      Matthew McGillis with contributions by Sisyphus.

    - Fix rim() 3-arg form.  Added tests to support and
      verify the development.

    - Fixed a problem with multiple windows and imag2d
      and imag2d_update.

 * The PDL shells keep getting better:

    - New feature in perldl and pdl2 where a pattern matching
      the PDL shell prompt (in $PERLDL::PREFIX_RE) will get
      stripped off of input lines before eval.  This makes it
      easier to cut-and-paste example text from PDL shell
      sessions or from the PDL Book into an active session.

    -  Added a demo for PDL::Graphics::Prima to the PDL shells.

    -  Added a demo for gnuplot to the PDL shells.

    -  The p shortcut to display output in the PDL shells has
       been reverted to its previous 2.4.10 behavior.  If you
       wish it to be an exact alias for print just override
       in your .perldlrc or local.perldlrc file.

   release is testing the new FilterSimple engine for
   PDL::NiceSlice.



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.11_005 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Another quick CPAN developers release
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

   - All tests may not pass, especially ones corresponding
     to issues in Known_problems.
   
   - Manual build/install is recommended although the
     cpan shell may be used by specifying the distribution
     path rather than just the module name, e.g.:

       cpan> get  CHM/PDL-2.4.11_005.tar.gz
       cpan> make CHM/PDL-2.4.11_005.tar.gz
       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.11_005.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.11_005.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Make t/gd_oo_tests.t skip for ALL BSD OSes if the
   AUTOMATED_TESTING environment variable is present.

 * Set the default PDL::NiceSlice filter engine to
   Filter::Simple.  This is to flush out any issues
   before making the new implementation the standard.

       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.11_004.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.11_004.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Added new FullDoc key to PDL::PP to make writing CPAN
   friendly .pd files much, much easier.

 * Newly refactored docs engine using core perl modules
   rather than local PDL ones.
 
 * Enhanced doc support for PDL::PP and some doc cleanup

 * Fixed a problem with multiple windows and imag2d and
   imag2d_update.

 * t/gd_oo_tests.t now skips tests for OpenBSD platforms
   to avoid many failures on CPAN Testers smokers.  If
   you can reproduce this problem (sf.net bug #3518190),
   help to debug would be greatly appreciated!

       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.11_003.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.11_003.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * t/gd_oo_tests.t now reports problems rather than failing
   for the known problem sf.net bug #3518190.  Help debugging
   this problem is welcome.

 * Minor doc fix to PDL::howbig so pdldoc apropos command
   will show that routine when given the string 'sizeof'.



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.11_002 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Another quick CPAN developers release
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete

       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.11_002.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Make the failing sign of NaN tests in t/pdl_from_string.t
   TODO until all the platform specific issues are fixed.

 * Add test names to t/gd_oo_tests.t subtests.



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.11_001 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Another quick CPAN developers release
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please

       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.11_001.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.11_001.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * perldl -glut support for the FreeGLUT or Apple GLUT
   has been modified to use the new Term::ReadLine
   event_loop method instead of previous custom code.
   If you install Term::ReadLine version 1.09 or
   greater, the GLUT event loop will run while the
   command line text interface is still active.  The
   imag2d routine will detect the feature and will not
   require twiddling to work with the display windows.

 * The p shortcut to display output in the PDL shells has
   been reverted to its previous 2.4.10 behavior.  If you
   wish it to be an exact alias for print just override in
   your .perldlrc or local.perldlrc file.

 * Added Boundary=>'Replicate' option to conv2d and med2d.

 * Added warning if conv1d is used on a piddle with the
   badflag set.  This prevents the unintentional corruption
   of numeric data by treating the badvalue as a number for
   convolution processing.

 * Fixed hist() handling of the case of fractional steps
   in integral input data types.  Sf.net bug #3588182

 * Fixed error report bug in perldl that resulted from a
   change in the way perl handles eval exception reporting.

 * Fix rim() 3-arg form.  Added tests to support and verify
   the development.

 * Fixed 16-bit PNM raw format handling (sf.net bug #3475075)

 * Fixed dummy() to generate a valid syntax for the underlying
   call to slice().  This was sf.net bug #3479009.
 
 * Fixed bug in PNG format detection on win32 platforms.
   Sf.net bug #3563903.

 * qsort[vec] are now inplace aware

 * Fix handling of complex 0 values.

 * Update polyfill and polyfillv routines to the algorithm
   from pnpoly: faster and more accurate on edge pixels.
 
 * PDL::IO::NDF has been moved to its own distribution on
   CPAN.

 * Added an unpdl method which is (roughly) the inverse
   operation of pdl in the sense that it generates a
   perl structure corresponding to the input piddle.
 
 * Add lgamma support for MinGW-built perls with tests
   to match.
 
 * Fix NaN sign issues as reported (and fixed!) by Matthew 
   McGillis with contributions by Sisyphus to resolve windows
   MVSC compiler/runtime issues.

 * Support for additional random number generators to PDL::GSL
   thanks to John Lapeyre.

 * Many debian distribution fixes.
 
 * Update docs database system to use Pod parsing modules
   distributed with Perl instead of the old PDL::Pod modules.



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.11  -----------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a point release of PDL to support the coming perl
   5.16.0 release.

 +---------------------------------------------------------------+
 | BE WARNED:  This release includes an update to the internal,  |
 | C-level PDL API and will require that you re-build any PP or  |
 | XS modules.  Do not upgrade or install over an existing PDL   |
 | installation unless you are prepared to do so!!!              |
 +---------------------------------------------------------------+


Highlights:

 * A new implementation mapflex and mapfraw routines provides
   memory-mapped IO for all platforms including win32 systems.

 * The new memory mapped IO support is implemented using
   File::Map so version 0.47 has been added as a required
   dependency to force automated testing so an automated build
   will need this dependency installed.
   
    NOTE: For systems having POSIX mmap, a manual build of
    PDL will automatically use the legacy implementation.

 * Various cleanup to existing code to fix warnings generated
   by perl versions 5.15.x and higher.
 
   Remove deprecation warning in PGPLOT/Window/Window.pm
   complex.pd - fix attempts to overload '<=>=' and '=>'

 * Sf.net bugs fixed:

    3518253  Make PDL::flat work under perl 5.16 (thanks sprout!)
    3516600  pdl_from_string.t fails w/ BADVAL_USENAN=1
    3487569  PDL::IO::Misc : rcols problem (thanks bperret!)
    3476648  PDL build of HTML docs fails on recent bleed Perl
    
 * Other bugs fixed:

    Fix check for glutRunning logic for imag2d
    Fixed a bug in cat's error reporting.
    Added lvalue awareness to whereND

 * New and improved tests have been added to the test suite.

    Tests t/gd_oo_tests.t and t/inline-comment-test.t are
    skipped for BSD platforms (see sf.net bugs #3518190 and
    #3524081 to track their issues).

 * New support for multi-line comments in PP code.  See docs for
   PDL::PP for details (e.g., pdldoc PP).
    
 * Various enhancements to barf/croak output and messages to make
   error reports and stack traces more useful and readable.

 * There is a new changes (or Changes) target for the PDL Makefile
   which is a convenience target that allows one to regenerate the
   Changes file from git.

       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.10_003.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Fix a missing declaration for add_deletedata_magic()
   which is believed to be the cause of the warning messages
   like:
   
     (in cleanup) Could not unmap: Invalid argument at t/fastraw.t line 63.
     (in cleanup) Could not unmap: Invalid argument at t/fastraw.t line 80.
     ...



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.10_002 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Rerelease of PDL-2.4.10_001 with reverted PROJ commit
   to enable build to complete for File::Map testing to
   occur.
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.10_001.tar.gz

 * File::Map 0.47 has been added as a dependency for
   testing purposes so an automated build will need
   this dependency installed.
   
   For systems having POSIX mmap, the build should
   still pass using the legacy implementation.


Highlights:

 * mapflex and mapfraw routines for memory-mapped IO have been
   refactored to use the File::Map module.  The new routines
   should work for all platforms having File::Map version 0.47
   or later installed.  This new implementation should work
   for both 32-bit and 64-bit perls as well as with 64-bit file
   offsets.  Please test and report.

 * Various cleanup to existing code to fix warnings generated
   by perl-5.15.
 
 * Other cleanup and bugs fixed (sf.net bug #3487569).



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.10 --------------------------

General Notes:

 New Stuff:

  * PDL::Constants module provides E, PI, I (or J) and more.

  * PDL::NiceSlice has a new engine based on Filter::Simple
    which is more selective about where the PDL::NiceSlice
    sourcefilter is applied.

  * pdl() constructor now accepts a string argument which
    can include MATLAB-style [ ; ] syntax, bad values,
    inf values, and nan values.  This makes it much easier
    to specify pdl values in programs and scripts.

  * PDL now supports pthreads on all platforms as well
    as a new, auto-parallelization capability for PDL
    threadloops across multiple processors using the
    PDL::ParallelCPU module.

  * Many(!) bug fixes.


 Incompatible Changes:

  * List output from whichND is now deprecated.

  * The default.perldlrc uses PDL::Constants to
    provide E and PI.

  * perldl.conf has new fields so be sure to update
    any local versions you use with the new fields.

  * rcols and wcols always use dim0 for the data
    dimension and dim1 for the column dimension.
    This only matters if you use the support for
    reading multiple columns into a 2D pdl.

  * Makefile.PL now requires at least version 6.31
    of ExtUtils::MakeMaker to support the new standard
    INSTALL_BASE option matching Module::Build usage.

  * Prerequisite Text::Balanced minimum version is
    now 1.89 although this is not expected to be an
    issue because it is provided in the perl core
    since 5.8.0.


Highlights:

 * General cleanup of code, including restructuring for clarity.
 
 * List output from whichND() is now deprecated.  whichND() now returns
   a piddle of coordinates in all cases with a warning when a list
   context is detected.  See the docs for work-arounds to your code.
 
 * PDL::IO::Misc now has better support for handles that are not
   files (e.g., pipes or standard input) for rgrep(), rcols(),...
 
 * Added bad value support to pctover() and oddpctover().
   This was sf.net feature #3328001.
 
 * New whereND() routine provides the same functionality as where
   but with support for multi-dimensional masks and implicit
   threading over higher dimensions.  This was sf.net feature
   request #3390043.
 
 * Many bugs fixed.

     3428356  PDL::Transform::map output FITS header is slightly wrong
     3434842  Error in definition of gsl_sf_laguerre_n function
 
 * PDL::Constants now provides: E, PI, I and J and is loaded by the
   default.perldlrc.  It is not yet part of 'use PDL' so you'll need
   to 'use PDL::Constants ...' by hand for now.
 
 * default.perldlrc sets $PDL::IO::FlexRaw::writeflexhdr=1 by
   default so that writeflex() to a filename automatically writes
   the header file.  This is different from the previous behavior
   but it seems to "do what you mean".  Feedback welcome!
 
 * PDL::NiceSlice now has a new engine based on Filter::Simple which
   is smarter about only applying the slicing source filter to syntax
   occurring outside of POD, comments, and quotelike strings.  The
   new implementation is available for *files* by setting the
   PDL_NICESLICE_ENGINE environment variable to 'Filter::Simple'.
 
   Work is underway to port the new niceslice filter implementation
   to perldl/pdl2.  Once this task is completed, the new engine will
   become the default source filter and the PDL_NICESLICE_ENGINE
   environment variable will be removed.
 
 * There is experimental support for PDL::NiceSlice syntax in the
   perl debugger (i.e., perl -d).  Just set the PERL5DB environment
   variable to 'BEGIN { require "PDLdb.pl" }' to use niceslice
   from the debugger command line.  If PERL5DB is already set,
   you'll need to adjust the above recipe accordingly.
 
 * Better handling of build configuration options from perldl.conf
   as well as improvements in the detection of external dependencies.
 
 * perldl.conf has some new fields added:
    - POSIX_THREADS_INC and POSIX_THREADS_LIBS to specify
          locations of your pthread header file and library
    - PDL_CONFIG_VERSION to track the perldl.conf VERSION
    - PDLDOC_IGNORE_AUTOLOADER to control pdldoc behavior
    - PDL_BUILD_DIR provides the build directory path
    - PDL_BUILD_VERSION provides the PDL build version
          (to help with ambiguity from multiple PDL installs)
 
   NOTE: If you are using a private or customized perldl.conf
   file, please be sure to update with these additional fields
   as the perl Makefile.PL doesn't yet detect version skew
   automatically.
  
 * PDL::IO::Browser now builds in many cases (but not all).
   If you try it, please let us know how it goes.  Just edit
   the value of WITH_IO_BROWSER in your perldl.conf before
   configuring the build (i.e., perl Makefile.PL).
 
 * PDL::PP has seen some significant improvements including
   code cleanup, improved documentation, and code refactoring
   for comprehension.  There is a new PDL::PP::pp_line_numbers()
   routine which enables line # traceback for errors and warnings
   from PP code.
 
 * Improved error output from the pdl2 shell via the new
   CleanErrors plugin which filters out the non-PDL part
   of the error output leading to *much* more concise and
   helpful reports.
 
 * The pdl() constructor now accepts a string argument which
   allows for writing pdls using a matlab/octave style
   syntax as well as cutting and pasting from interactive
   session output to create pdls initializations for scripts
   and program files.
   
   The new constructor also allows for inf, nan, and bad to
   generate the appropriate values (case insensitive), e.g.,
 
      $bad = pdl q[1 2 3 bad 5 6];  # Set fourth element to the bad value
      $bad = pdl q[1 2 3 BAD 5 6];  # ditto
      $bad = pdl q[1 2 inf bad 5];  # now third element is IEEE infinite value
      $bad = pdl q[nan 2 inf -inf]; # first value is IEEE nan value
 
   This is new functionality so feedback and problem reports
   are welcome.
 
 * PDL::Image2D has new routines: pnpoly() to determine the points
   in a polygon from the sequence of vertex coordinates, and
   cc4compt() for 4-component labeling of a binary image.
 
 * PDL now supports pdls larger than 2GiB.  The element count
   is still an int type internally so the total number of elements
   per-piddle must be less than 2**31.
 
 * POSIX threads (pthreads) are supported for win32 and cygwin
   platforms.  Pthreads are now available for all PDL platforms.
 
 * New PDL::ParallelCPU module provides automatic distribution
   of implicit thread loops across a number of processors.  Now
   you can watch your PDL computations maximize the load on
   *all* your processors.  See the docs for how to configure this
   feature and how to adjust your calculations to best take
   advantage of this feature.
 
 * PDL::Graphics::PLplot now works with the latest release of the
   PLplot library and has improved configuration and build
   handling.  Feedback welcome.
 
 * rcols() and wcols() now use the same convention for multi-column
   input and output: dim0 is *always* the data dimension and
   dim1 corresponds to the columns in the file.  This adjustment
   makes them their inverse operations.
 
 * The ADEV calculation in statsover has been corrected along
   with the documentation.
 
 * PDL::Graphics::TriD changes:
    - PDL::Graphics::TriD now builds using the perl OpenGL
          module (POGL) when configured on cygwin with the
          interface=W32API option.  By default, POGL used
          interface=GLX on cygwin which does software rendering
          via Mesa/X11 (slower!).  If you reinstall POGL with
          the W32API setting, you will need to rebuild PDL and
          PDL::Graphics::TriD to pick up the new configuration.
    - A new 4-line graphics demo contributed by Mark Baker has
          been added to 'demo 3dgal'.  Take a look.
 
 * Various enhancements to FITS handling, including:
   - add map() fix for nonlinear FITS headers
   - Enable hdrpcy() in rfits() for Rice-compressed images
 
 * Test suite improvements to provide better diagnostics from
   failures and to make tests more correct avoiding "false fails"
   in the test reports.  Various tests have been migrated to use
   File::Temp::tempdir and File::Temp::tempfile to improve the
   robustness for temporary files and directories naming and
   creation during tests.
 
 * Update ExtUtils::MakeMaker required version to 6.31 to support
   the new standard of INSTALL_BASE to configure for a local
   perl/PDL module installation.
 
 * Update Text::Balanced required version to 1.89.  This is the
   version present in perl 5.8.0 (the minimum required for PDL)
   so this change in requirement is not expected to affect any
   PDL users.
 
 * pdldoc now searches your PDLLIB path for PDL::AutoLoader docs
   in addition to the pre-extracted documentation database.  This
   makes pdldoc give the same output as the help command in the
   PDL shells.
 
 * Many updates and additions to the PDL documentation.
 
 * Devel::CheckLib is being used in more places during the
   PDL configuration stage.  We plan to make this the standard
   baseline for dependency library detection going forwards.
   The included copy of Devel::CheckLib has been updated to 0.95.
 
 * A new unified implementation of barf()/warn() for PDL removes
   code duplication.  barf() is now defined in both PDL::Core and
   the PDL packages.  PDL::cluck is added as an analog of Carp::cluck
   (as PDL::barf is an analog of Carp::confess).  barf() now
   generates its stack trace by hooking into Carp::confess on
   both the Perl and C sides.
 
 * Various fixes for PDL::Transform
   - fix inverse in perspective()
   - fix t_cubic() parameter parsing
   - fix handling of multiple PCi_j systems in the piddle header
 
 * Added SIGPIPE handlers to cases where PDL uses pipes to/from
   external processes (such as ffmpeg or some NetPBM image
   converter programs).  This should make PDL "SIGPIPE safe" by not
   exiting when a PDL piped IO output process quits (e.g., as when
   called from within the perldl/pdl2 shell).

Highlights:

 * TBD



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.9_016 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is the final CPAN developers release for PDL
   code changes.  The next release will be release
   candidate 1 and all focus will be on documentation,
   web page updates, and writing the PDL Book...
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

   - All tests may not pass, especially ones corresponding
     to issues in Known_problems.
   
   - Manual build/install is recommended although the
     cpan shell may be used by specifying the distribution
     path rather than just the module name, e.g.:

       cpan> get  CHM/PDL-2.4.9_016.tar.gz
       cpan> make CHM/PDL-2.4.9_016.tar.gz
       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.9_016.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.9_016.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Updated win32/INSTALL instructions.

 * Added curses library detection for PDL::IO::Browser using
   Devel::CheckLib.  This is untested and disabled by
   default but if you set WITH_IO_BROWSER => 1 in the
   perldl.conf, it should build if your platform supports
   curses.
   
   NOTE: PDL::IO:Browser is not available for win32 perls
   since we still need to sort out an appropriate add-on
   curses implementation and verify it works.
 
 * Rework some tests to quiet warnings and to reduce
   false fails (usually from floating point == tests).

 * Better corner-case handling when creating a pdl from a string.
   For example, this doesn't make sense:
     pdl q[1 +-2 3]
   but it used to give a piddle with values [1, -2, 3], basically
   ignoring the first plus sign. That now croaks.
   
   Additionally, this used to croak, but the error message was
   useless:
     pdl q[1 pie 3]
   The new parsing will croak with a much more useful error:
     found 'e' as part of a larger word in 1 pie 2
 
 * Improved pthread detection for windows with Devel::CheckLib



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.9_015 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Another quick CPAN developers release
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

   - All tests may not pass, especially ones corresponding
     to issues in Known_problems.
   
   - Manual build/install is recommended although the
     cpan shell may be used by specifying the distribution
     path rather than just the module name, e.g.:

       cpan> get  CHM/PDL-2.4.9_015.tar.gz
       cpan> make CHM/PDL-2.4.9_015.tar.gz
       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.9_015.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.9_015.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Cleaner error reporting from the pdl2 shell.  Stops
   printing the callback trace once the PDL relevant
   parts are done.

 * Candidate fix for sf.net bug #
   3460886    t/flexraw_fortran.t test failures
 
 * Added PDL_BUILD_VERSION to the perldl.conf keys.
   This value is generated by the Makefile.PL config
   process and provides a consistency check by ensuring
   the Config.pm is from the correct version of PDL.
 
 * Replace tempfile and tempdir based on hand-rolled
   from TMPDIR in perldl.conf by calls to File::Temp
   tempfile and/or tempdir.  Fixes to tests and trylink
   command.
 
 * Update minimum version of ExtUtils::MakeMaker to
   6.31 which is the first version supporting the
   INSTALL_BASE option for local module repo locations.
   This is the same location as the Module::Build
   --install-base option and is much easier to
   understand where things go than the PREFIX + LIB.

   NOTE: If you've been using PREFIX + LIB for your
   standalone repository configuration, you'll need
   to reinstall with the new option.  Mix and matching
   the two is liable to cause problems.



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.9_014 --------------------------

 * Another quick CPAN developers release
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

       cpan> make CHM/PDL-2.4.9_014.tar.gz
       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.9_014.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.9_014.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Add imaginary unit (either I and/or J) to PDL::Constants
   and make all constants EXPORT_OK() rather than EXPORT().
   Some documentation updates.

 * Minor cleanups to PDL::PP and related modules to get rid
   of warnings under new Perls during testing.
 
 * Added pp_line_numbers to PDL::PP to improve line number
   reporting when the compiler runs into an error with
   PDL::PP code.
 
 * Add pnpoly implementation and fixes to PDL::Image2D

 * Candidate fix to PDL::Minuit Makefile.PL



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.9_013 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Another quick CPAN developers release
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

     cpan shell may be used by specifying the distribution
     path rather than just the module name, e.g.:

       cpan> get  CHM/PDL-2.4.9_013.tar.gz
       cpan> make CHM/PDL-2.4.9_013.tar.gz
       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.9_013.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.9_013.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Add workaround for pthread detection on *BSD systems to
   avoid CPAN Testers failures due to miss-detection and
   auto-configuration.

 * Update t/proj_transform.t and t/proj_transform2.t test
   data to be consistent with the new FITS coordinate
   handling fix.

 * Add a new cc4compt routine in PDL::Image2D which provides
   4-component labeling to go with the existing cc8compt which
   provides 8-component labeling.

 * Added test time diagnostics to PDL::IO::Pic test that
   print the converter hash values if any tests fail.
 
 * Documentation additions.



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.9_012 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Another quick CPAN developers release
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

       cpan> make CHM/PDL-2.4.9_012.tar.gz
       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.9_012.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.9_012.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Quick re-release to include Basic/Core/Makefile.PL fixes
   from git
 
 * Fixed new t/proj_transform2.t test failure that was a
   side effect off the newly more correct FITS coordinate
   handling.



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.9_011 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Another quick CPAN developers release
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

   - All tests may not pass, especially ones corresponding

     cpan shell may be used by specifying the distribution
     path rather than just the module name, e.g.:

       cpan> get  CHM/PDL-2.4.9_011.tar.gz
       cpan> make CHM/PDL-2.4.9_011.tar.gz
       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.9_011.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.9_011.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * SF.net bugs fixed:

   - 3410905  t/pgplot.t hangs test harness for PDL
              Now use the PGPLOT /NULL device if running
              under Test::Harness.

   - 3428356  PDL::Transform::map output FITS header is slightly wrong 	

   - 3080505  PLplot segfaults on plshades call on OS X

   - 3059083  Problems with FITS header handling

 * The perl crash in t/pthreadBarf.t for win32 has been fixed.
   The problem was that Perl's realloc was being used instead
   of the system malloc/realloc.

 * Fix build for PROJ4 submodules so that setting WITH_PROJ to
   1 with force a build whether or not the configure type checks
   can verify the build options.  This allows the end user to
   work around auto-detection issues when needed.
   
   NOTE: Even with the override, the check are still done---just
   ignored in the decision process.

 * Various documentation and updates.



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.9_010 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Another quick CPAN developers release
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

   - All tests may not pass, especially ones corresponding
     to issues in Known_problems.
   
   - Manual build/install is recommended although the
     cpan shell may be used by specifying the distribution
     path rather than just the module name, e.g.:

       cpan> get  CHM/PDL-2.4.9_010.tar.gz
       cpan> make CHM/PDL-2.4.9_010.tar.gz
       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.9_010.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.9_010.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Experimental PDL::NiceSlice support for perl debugger.
   Just put the PDLdb.pl file in your perl @INC path and
   do an

     export PERL5DB='BEGIN { require "PDLdb.pl" }'
     setenv PERL5DB 'BEGIN { require "PDLdb.pl" }'

   You should be able to use niceslice syntax to view
   or modify pdl values.  Feedback welcome!

 * New pdl from string functionality in pdl constructors
   new and pdl now supports BAD, NAN, and INF values as
   entries in the piddle being constructed.  E.g., this
   now works:

     pdl> p $a = pdl q[ inf bad 0 0 ];
     [inf BAD 0 0]

 * Fixed security vulnerability in and added functionality
   to PDL::Core::new_pdl_from_string.
   
   - replaced an eval with a Perl-level parse of the string

   - added support for the strings 'inf', 'nan', and 'bad',
     as well as the Windows printouts of those values
   
   In the past, using new_pdl_from_string with a stringified
   piddle worked as long as the piddle didn't have infinity,
   not-a-number, or BAD values. Now, that works. This is also
   useful for generating data to test edge cases.


 * Fixed sf.net bugs:

   - 3434842  Error in definition of gsl_sf_laguerre_n function
   - 3391507  pdl2 docs not found by pdldoc
   - 3391645  bad printf formats in pdlapi.c and others

 * Resolved sf.net feature requests with clarified documentation
   and more diagnostic error messages:

   - 3396738  PDL::Core::convert default return type
   - 3396761  fix rvals arithmetic wrap-around for byte types



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.9_009 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Another quick CPAN developers release
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

   - All tests may not pass, especially ones corresponding
     to issues in Known_problems.
   
   - Manual build/install is recommended although the
     cpan shell may be used by specifying the distribution
     path rather than just the module name, e.g.:

       cpan> get  CHM/PDL-2.4.9_009.tar.gz
       cpan> make CHM/PDL-2.4.9_009.tar.gz
       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.9_009.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.9_009.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Work underway to enable POSIX theads support for
   win32 systems (native windows perls and cygwin).
   Manual build is possible for cygwin and MSWin32.

 * PDL segfault on Empty pdl bugs fixed:

   - 3307613   indexND of Empty pdls can segfault
   - 3294808   sever on Empty piddle causes segfault

 * Other bugs fixed:

   - 3415115   whereND fails to handle all zero mask case
   - .......   rcols dies when you reading past the EOF
   - .......   fixed readflex edge case with badvalues

 * wcols can now write 2D pdls directly with the
   column data going to dim0 and dim1 corresponding
   to the number of colums written to the file for
   that pdl.  rcols now uses the same convention for
   2D pdls which makes dim0 the data dimension for
   both 1D and 2D pdls *and* make rcols and wcols
   the reverse operations from each other.

 * Documentation and diagnostic improvements for PDL::PP
   from investigation and study by David Mertens.

 * Various clean-up and tidying of PDL as a release.

 * New engine for PDL::NiceSlice offers improved
   selectivity as a source filter regarding sf.net
   bug #3018731 'NiceSlice affects code where it should not'.
   The main improvement from the new code is it should
   not filter in perl comments or quotelike constructs.
   
   To try the new sourcefilter "engine", set the environment
   variable PDL_NICESLICE_ENGINE to either of:

    Filter::Util::Call (for the original filter version)
    Filter::Simple     (for the new and improved engine)
   
   NOTE: the current default is Filter::Util::Call although
   that may change for some CPAN developers release testing.
   Also, if you enter an invalid option, PDL::NiceSlice will
   die.

   NOTE: Work is underway to finish the implementation
   for the interactive PDL shells: perldl and pdl2.  You
   get the Filter::Util::Call behavior for the shells
   regardless of the choice of filter engine at this time.

Highlights:

 * Enabled more pnmtoxxx converters for t/pnm.t and t/picrgb.t.
   The idea is to revisit any issues with the NetPBM installs
   as the previous problems might be better handled by better
   configuration and tests.

 * Multiple sf.net bugs fixed:

   - 3394327    PDL::IO::FITS::wfits corrupting FITS image
   - 3392972    t/pthreadBarf.t test fails
   - 3377113    failure to find PDL typemap
   - 3303673    PLplot trouble with new PThreads



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.9_007 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Another quick CPAN developers release
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

   - All tests may not pass, especially ones corresponding
     to issues in Known_problems.
   
   - Manual build/install is recommended although the
     cpan shell may be used by specifying the distribution
     path rather than just the module name, e.g.:

       cpan> get  CHM/PDL-2.4.9_007.tar.gz
       cpan> make CHM/PDL-2.4.9_007.tar.gz
       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.9_007.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.9_007.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Candidate fix for sf.net bug # 3394327  (thanks to
   kxtor).  It would be great if we had a small test
   to add to t/fits.t showing the problem with the
   original code.

 * Candidate fix for sf.net bug # 3392972 (thanks to
   John Cerney).  It appears that some of the cleanup
   from the PDL_Long typemap problem had a side-effect
   with the previous barf code.

 * Candidate fix for sf.net bug # 3377113 (thanks to
   Rob/sisyphus for following up with this).  The latest
   spin seems to fix the problem.
 
 * Ported t/pthreadBarf.t to use Test::More.

       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.9_005.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Fix for missing PDL_Long * typemap in Core.xs bug



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.9_004 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Another quick CPAN developers release
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

   - All tests may not pass, especially ones corresponding
     to issues in Known_problems.
   
   - Manual build/install is recommended although the
     cpan shell may be used by specifying the distribution
     path rather than just the module name, e.g.:

       cpan> get  CHM/PDL-2.4.9_004.tar.gz
       cpan> make CHM/PDL-2.4.9_004.tar.gz
       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.9_004.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.9_004.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Add 'use PDL::Constants' to default.perldl in preparation
   for eventual inclusion for 'use PDL'.  The PDL::Constants
   module only defines PI and E at the moment.  I would like
   to see a few more standard ones added such as I or J for
   the imaginary unit value.

 * Set $PDL::IO::FlexRaw::writeflexhdr=1 in PDL shell.  This
   enables writeflex() to call writeflexhdr() automatically
   when a filename is given as the output destination.  This
   matches the behavior of writefraw() but is different than
   the previous behavior so only enable the new default in
   the interactive shells (for now).


 * Preliminary support for pdls larger than 2GiB (but still
   with less than 2**31 *elements*) is in the PDL core.
   It is believed that this modification should be
   transparent.  Please test.

 * New whereND() routine added to PDL::Primitive.  Like
   where but it properly threads the mask over higher
   data dimensions.  This was sf.net feature #3390043.
 
 * pdldoc now searches for *.pdl files in your @PDLLIB
   path for docs on PDL::AutoLoader routines.  To disable
   the new behavior, just set the new perldl.conf option
   PDLDOC_IGNORE_AUTOLOADER to true.  This was sf.net
   feature #3390042.

 * Documentation fixes

 * SF.net bugs fixed:
   - 3388862  tiny bug in PDL-2.4.3. May apply to 2.4.9
   - 3375837  _read_flexhdr state machine fails
   - 3368883  t/opengl.t fails if display type not available

       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.9_003.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.9_003.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * PDL now requires Text::Balanced version 1.89 or higher.

   NOTE: All perls with versions 5.8.0+ have at least this
   version of Text::Balanced in the Core module set.

 * Fix wmpeg crash when ffmpeg generates an error with a
   $SIG{PIPE}, sf.net #3307121.  Added $SIG{PIPE} fixes
   for other PDL modules using pipes.
 
 * PDL::NiceSlice being refactored to use Filter::Simple.
 
 * pctover, oddpctover, pct, and oddpct now support badvalues
   per sf.net feature request #3328001.

 * Fixed t/opengl.t problem to enable support for TriD to
   work with POGL compiled under cygwin for the w32api
   OpenGL graphics.

 * Improved diagnostic output on failure ("better barf").

 * Fix wcols() regression where file handle arguments
   were not being handled correctly.
 
 * Various documentation and distributions fixes.

 * Improved detection logic for a number of external
   dependencies
 
 * Fix double-bscale bug for rice-compressed images

 * Adapt t/bad.t to use File::Temp::tempfile() instead
   of a hand-rolled version.  Eventually we would like
   to standardize on File::Temp for our temp file work.



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.9 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Fixes a couple of surprise bugs that were discovered
   immediately with the PDL-2.4.8 release.

 * See Also: the Release Notes for PDL-2.4.8 below


Highlights:

 * Fix sf.net bug #3267408 "t/slice.t crashes in tests 68-70 for BSD"
 
 * Fix sf.net bug #3190227 "PDL build fails with parallel GNU make -j3 -j3"

 * Fixed various tempfile name generation problems by switching
   to File::Temp instead of hand rolled solutions.  This is the

Highlights:

 * Fixed sf.net bug #3267408 "t/slice.t crashes in tests 68-70 for BSD"



Release Notes for PDL 2.4.8 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * The deprecated Karma imaging library support code
   has been removed from the PDL distribution.
 
 * Perl OpenGL (POGL) is now the only build option for
   3-D graphics support in PDL.  The POGL build has
   proven to be portable and reliable.  This prepares
   TriD graphics development for the next stage of
   re-factoring for support and new features.
 
 * Many improvements to the PDL configuration, build
   and test process make this the most robust PDL yet.
 
 * PDL::IO::FlexRaw now supports automatic header file
   creation when writeflex() is given a filename argument
   for writing.  readflex/writeflex/mapflex now support
   reading and writing piddles with bad values in them.
 
 * New PDL::Constants module provides PI and E.

 * PDL::Complex now supports in-place operations.

 * Added $PDL::toolongtoprint to set the maximum piddle
   size allowed to print as a string.  This was added
   to the default.perldlrc to make it easier to discover
   by users.

 * wmpeg() from PDL::IO::Pic uses the new ffmpeg back-end
   and can create many additional file formats beyond MPEG
   alone, including MP4 and animated GIF.  See the
   documentation for details.
 
 * Lots of improvements to the documentation, overall
   usability and many bugs fixed!

Highlights:

 Build and Test Enhancements:

 * Karma support code has been *removed* from the PDL
   distribution The last stable PDL distribution with
   Karma code was be PDL-2.4.7.
   
 * You must use the Perl OpenGL module to build the
   PDL 3-D graphics module, PDL::Graphics::TriD.
   OPENGL_LIBS, OPENGL_INC and OPENGL_DEFINE are no
   longer used by perldl.conf for the configuration
   process.
   
 * Added a check for mis-installed PROJ4 libraries.  If
   the library does not initialize (even if present) then
   PDL will not build the PROJ4 modules.  This is sf.net
   feature #3045456.
   
 * GD, HDF, PROJ4, OpenGL, and GSL tests will not be run
   unless the corresponding module was configured to be
   built.  This addresses the possibly mysterious test
   failures caused by previous PDL installations in the
   perl path at build time.
   
 * Use of the Test::More TODO {} blocks allows tests for
   known bugs to be added to the test suite without 
   causing the suite to fail.  This replaces the previous
   SKIP_KNOWN_PROBLEMS option and should better enable
   test first development and debugging.
   
 * utils/perldlpp.pl is a new script for off-line source
   filtering to pre-filter PDL source files with NiceSlice
   constructs.  This allows PDL to use NiceSlice constructs
   in the core functionality while still allowing PDL to
   work in environments where source filters are not supported.
   
 * The 'perl Makefile.PL' response to detecting another PDL
   in the build path has changed.  If such a pre-existing PDL
   installation is detected, the user is warned *but*
   configuration and build will proceed nonetheless.
   
 * Clean-up and fixes to demos and tests for reliability and
   portability.

 Documentation:

 * Added INTERNATIONALIZATION file with i18n notes.  PDL
   does yet not have internationalization support beyond
   that provided  by perl itself.
   
 * Cleared up the documentation on when to use lu_decomp
   and versus lu_decomp2.  Now that lu_decomp is threaded,
   it is the preferred implementation.
   
 * wmpeg() with the ffmpeg converter supports generation of
   many different output video file formats including MPEG,
   MP4, and animated GIF.  Documentation on these uses were
   added.

 * New example code refresh.pdl in Example/PLplot to
   provide for PLplot, some of the same functionality
   as in PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT.
   
 * Other documentation updates for clarity and correctness.

 New Features or Functionality:

 * New PDL::Constants module providing PI and E (so far)
   
 * Inplace support added for PDL::Complex operations
   
 * pdldoc and the pdl2/perldl help commands now print all
   matches by default when multiple matches are found.

 * A do_print command was added to the pdl2 shell which
   toggles the input mode between printing and not
   printing the return value of each command.
   
 * readflex/writeflex/mapflex now support reading and writing  
   piddles with bad values in them. This was sf.net feature
   request #3028127, "add badvalue support to FlexRaw".
   
 * writeflex now supports automatically calling the
   writeflexhdr() routine if you have set the variable
   $PDL::FlexRaw::writeflexhdr to a true value and are
   writing to a file given by filename as argument.
   
 * Updated the error handling for GSL::INTERP to match other
   GSL module usages.
   
 * Applied sf.net patch #3209075 IO::HDF square sds
   
 * New binary blob support in PDL::IO::GD::OO

 Bugs Fixed:

 * Applied Christian Soeller's patch for FFTW on 64-bit
   systems.  This resolves bug #3203480 "t/fftw.t fails
   on 64-bit systems".
   
 * Fixed sf.net bug #3172882 re broken threading in inv().
   inv() and lu_backsub() now handle threading.  Updated
   documentation for lu_decomp, lu_deomp2, and lu_backsub.
   
 * Fixed sf.net bug #3171702 "missing podselect command
   breaks PDL build"
   
 * Fixed sf.net bug #3185864 (bad adev in statsover)
   
 * Fixed sf.net bug #3139697: fixed imag2d() to work better
   with Mac OS X GLUT and not just FreeGLUT.
   
 * Fixed uniqind bug #3076570
   
 * Fixed SF bug #3057542: wmpeg doesn't error on missing
   ffmpeg program.  Now wmpeg returns 1 on success and
   undef on error.  If ffmpeg is not in PATH, it just fails
   immediately....
   
 * Fixed SF bug #3056142: pdl2 fallback to perldl broken
   on win32
   
 * Fixed SF bug #3042201: t/dumper.t fails mysteriously
   
 * Fixed SF bug #3031068: PDL::IO::FlexRaw mapflex memory
   mapping fails
   
 * Fixed SF bug #3011879, "pdl() constructor crashes perl for
   mixed ref/piddle args" and #3080505, and #3139088.  This
   fix also includes a larger and more complete set of tests.
   
 * Fixed segfault in plplot.t with a work-around.
   
 * Fixed bug in readenvi.pdl header list value processing
   and added support for embedded file headers.
   
 * Fixed bug in FlexRaw.pm support for headers with Type
   passed  as string.
   
 * Fixed imag2d() in PDL::Graphics2D.  It no longer calls
   exit on ESC if run within the pdl2/perldl shell.  Also
   did some clean up of key controls and module mechanics.
   
 * Fixed upstream bug in Devel::REPL for MultiLine
   continuation.  Now incomplete q[] and qq[] constructs
   continue reading until properly closed.  See the
   Known_problems file for details.

       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.7_013.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * readflex/writeflex/mapflex now support reading and writing
   piddles with bad value support enabled.  This was sf.net
   feature request #3028127, "add badvalue support to FlexRaw".
   
   On writeflex, a piddle with badflag==1 will have a keyword
   badvalue added to the header file and an additional value
   if badvalue is != orig_badvalue for that type.
   
   On readflex, a piddle with the badvalue header will
   automatically have its badflag set and its badvalue as well
   if it is not the default.

 * New PDL::Constants module providing PI and E

 * New refresh.pdl in Example/PLplot.  This provides
   some of the same functionality as in the PDL
   PGPLOT graphics.

 * Inplace support added for PDL::Complex operations

 * OPENGL_LIBS, OPENGL_INC and OPENGL_DEFINE
   no longer used in perldl.conf as the Perl
   OpenGL binding is now required for TriD graphics.
 
 * Additional code clean up now that PDL::Karma
   graphics are no longer provided.
 
 * Various bug and documentation fixes.


    
Release Notes for PDL 2.4.7_012 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release!
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

   - All tests may not pass, especially ones corresponding
     to issues in Known_problems.
   
   - Manual build/install is recommended although the
     cpan shell may be used by specifying the distribution
     path rather than just the module name, e.g.:

       cpan> get  CHM/PDL-2.4.7_012.tar.gz
       cpan> make CHM/PDL-2.4.7_012.tar.gz
       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.7_012.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.7_012.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Fixed pdl constructor bugs

   - Include a larger and more-complete set of tests.

   - Fixes SF.net bugs: #3011879, #3080505, and #3139088.

   - Please test and verify.

 * Legacy (deprecated) X11+PP build of TriD OpenGL bindings
   has been removed

     You must use the new Perl OpenGL based build which has
     proven to be more portable and reliable.  This prepares
     TriD graphics development for the next stage of refactoring
     for support and functionality.

 * More tests have been updated to not run unless the feature
   they test was actually built.  This addresses the possible
   mysterious test failures caused by previous PDL installs
   in the perl path at build time.

   - t/opengl.t will not run if TriD graphics have not been built

   - t/gsl*.t tests will not run if WITH_GSL => 0

 * Remove Karma support code from PDL distribution
    
     The last stable CPAN distribution with Karma code
     in it (though deprecated) will be PDL-2.4.7.

 * Added INTERNATIONALIZATION file with i18n notes

     PDL does not have internationalization support beyond
     that provided by perl itself.  In fact, some of the
     code may be specific to English and ASCII for file names
     and strings.  This file is a place holder and reminder
     to address these issues.

 * Some documentation and FAQ updates.

       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.7_009.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.7_009.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Update Known_problems, Perldl2/TODO, Release_Notes
    
 * Fixed upstream bug in Devel::REPL for MultiLine continuation
   so now incomplete q[] and qq[] constructs continue reading
   until properly closed.  This was a problem for pdl2 and its
   multiline support.

 *  Fix sf.net bug #3172882 re broken threading in inv
    - inv() and lu_backsub() now handle threading
    - documentation updates for lu_decomp, lu_deomp2, lu_backsub

 * Fix imag2d not to exit on ESC in pdl2/perldl
   Clean up PAUSE/STEP key controls for imag2d()
   Add imag2d_update to EXPORT_OK and fix bug
    
     There are preliminary key bindings for the default
     imag2d() windows to support SPACE to toggle pause,
     [ . or > ] to step/move forward, and [ , or < ] to
     move backward through frame data.

 * clean up tests for PLplot functions
   - common code in tests for PLplot functions has been abstracted
   - plsfont & plgfont interfaces are now conditional on their existence
   - OPTIONS! file is now Perl code.
   - all conditional code API code is now based on
      presence of a feature rather than version

 * readenvi doc/code cleanup, ignore case in hdr keys
    
 * wmpeg() with the ffmpeg converter supports generation
   of many different output video file formats including
   MPEG, MP4, and animated GIF.  Documentation on these
   uses were added.



Release notes for PDL 2.4.7_008 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release!
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These Release Notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see Changes (from the git log) for full details.

   - All tests may not pass, especially ones corresponding
     to issues in Known_problems.
   
   - Manual build/install is recommended although the
     cpan shell may be used by specifying the distribution
     path rather than just the module name, e.g.:

       cpan> get  CHM/PDL-2.4.7_008.tar.gz
       cpan> make CHM/PDL-2.4.7_008.tar.gz
       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.7_008.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.7_008.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Merged PDL version of Graphics/PLplot with the stand-alone
   package from CPAN, version 0.53.

 * Fixed segfault in plplot.t by avoiding the problem:  pdl($pdl->sclr).
   Calls to pdl() with arguments that are themselves PDLs still fails.

 * Fixed sf.net bug #3139697: The imag2d() routine was using
   FreeGLUT-specific macros: GLUT_ACTION_ON_WINDOW_CLOSE and
   GLUT_ACTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION which was a problem on OS X
   GLUT which does not support them.  Added check for FreeGLUT
   to conditionalize their use.
 
 * Update PDL::IO::FlexRaw POD for writeflex

 * Add open MODE support to writeflex "filename"
     
     writeflex is documented to take as argument either a "filename"
     or a FILEHANDLE however if passed something like ">filename" as
     the file argument, it would quietly (and unexpectedly) open the
     file ">$name" which would then be ">>filename" and the data would
     be appended to the file rather than overwriting it.

     This modifies the "filename" option to be used explicitly if
     passed a perl open type MODE+filename expression which might
     avoid someone's utter confusion in the future...



Release notes for PDL 2.4.7_007 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release!
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete

       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.7_007.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.7_007.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Added do_print command to pdl2 shell which toggles the
   input mode between printing and not printing the value
   of each command.

 * Cleaned up documentation on when to use lu_decomp and
   lu_decomp2.  Now that lu_decomp is threaded, it is the
   preferred implementation.
 
 * pdldoc and the pdl2/perldl help commands now print
   all matches by default when multiple matches are
   found.  It is easier to use the pager than to re-enter
   the help command with a [$n] on it.
 
 * Fixed SF bug #3056142: pdl2 fallback to perldl broken on win32

 * Fixed documentation for the PDL::hist routine where
   use of the unix man convention of []'s around optional
   arguements was confusing in PDL since [] are valid
   perl delimiters/constructs.
 
 * writeflex now supports automatically calling the
   writeflexhdr routine if you have set the variable
   $PDL::FlexRaw::writeflexhdr to a true value.
 
 * Use standard abbreviations for piddle info output
   for sizes (KB and MB rather than Kb and Mb).

       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.7_006.tar.gz


Highlights:

 * Fixed SF bug #3031068: PDL::IO::FlexRaw mapflex memory mapping fails

 * Fixed SF bug #3042201: t/dumper.t fails mysteriously

 * Added detection and skips for bad PROJ4 installs to t/proj_transform.t
   and t/proj_transform2.t

 * Added new global setting to control maximum PDL print size,
   $PDL::longbigtoprint, and added POD to Core.pm.PL covering
   these important PDL package variables.

 * Fixed SF bug #3057542: wmpeg doesn't error on missing ffmpeg.
   Now wmpeg returns 1 on success and undef on error.  If ffmpeg
   is not in PATH, just fail immediately....

       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.7_004.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.7_004.tar.gz



Highlights:

 * Modify the XS_PDL_address routine in Core.xs to convert
   the pdl pointer to an IV rather than an int.  Adjusted
   PDL::address in Core.pm to format the resulting value
   correctly.

 * Fix missing stdlib.h include for Lib/Image2D/resample.h

 * Fix bug in readenvi header list value processing and
   add support for non-zero imbedded file header size.
 
 * Refactored t/complex.t to use Test::More

 * Fix bug in FlexRaw.pm support for headers with
   Type passed as string.  There was a case where
   'double' was being pased to the PDL::howbig which
   generated an error on some platforms.  It is not
   clear why this did not fail on all platforms.
 



Release notes for PDL 2.4.7_003 --------------------------

       cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.7_003.tar.gz
       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.7_003.tar.gz



Highlights:

 * Sf.net bug #3011879, pdl() constructor crashes perl
   for mixed ref/piddle args has been fixed and is
   available for general use and testing this release.

 * utils/perldlpp.pl is a new PDL utility for off-line
   source filtering to pre-filter perl source files for
   NiceSlice constructs.  This allows the functionality
   to be used in environments not supporting direct
   use of source filters.
 
 * Various fixes to transform.pd.

 * Various clean-ups of docs, POD, and tests.

 * Set the default GSL error handler for GSL/INTERP
   to support perl exception handling rather than
   having the interpreter exit.

       cpan> look CHM/PDL-2.4.7_002.tar.gz



Highlights:

 * Replace SKIP_KNOWN_PROBLEMS by Test::More's TODO
   blocks.
   
   NOTE: To avoid FAILs for the Known_Problems
   tests, just set the environment variable
   SKIP_KNOWN_PROBLEMS or edit the perldl.conf file
   and set the SKIP_KNOWN_PROBLEMS to 1.




Release notes for PDL 2.4.7_001 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release!
 
   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete

     README type files.
 
 * Fixed pdldoc to use PERLDOC_PAGER if set.
 
 * Various minor fixed to POD documentation
 
 * Fixes to t/fastraw.t to clean up working files on exit
     and to removed intermediate files at each stage.
     Some tests were failing because of pre-existing files
     left from other runs.
 
 * Partial fix to #3079844 where very long tmpdir pathnames
     created invalid fortran test code.  The final fix will
     be to skip this test for such pathalogical pathname
     lengths and add another test with modern fortran file
     syntax rather than f77-era 80 character lines.
 
 * Updated FITS.pm to handle BSCALE/BZERO correctly for
     tile-compressed images
 
 * Add win32 workaround for pdl2->perldl exec bug #3056142.
     Now win32 just exits pdl2 with a warning to run perldl
     rather than trying the broken exec.
 
 * Fixed uniqind bug #3076570
 
 * Fixed Demos/Cartography_demo.pm and Demos/Transform_demo.pm
     to use the /GW driver on MSWin32 systems only.

Release notes for PDL 2.4.7 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * New requirements:
   - perl version 5.8.x and higher
   - Convert::UU
 
 * PDL::Graphics::TriD now requires OpenGL-0.63
 
 * New 2-D image display routine: imag2d()

 * pdl() constructor, a.k.a. PDL->new(), now
   takes string arguments with either MATLAB type
   concatenation syntax or PDL print output (for
   easier cut-and-paste from PDL shell sessions).

 * Improved text and comma separated value file
   input via rcols(): faster and more flexible.
 
 * A new PDL shell based on Devel::REPL (i.e.,
   Moose technology).  The new shell supports
   more perl syntax (lexical variables and
   packages), is more extensible (via a system
   of plugins), and supports many forms of file
   and variable completion.
   
   Install Devel::REPL and give it a try!
   User feedback welcome.

 * More portability (builds on more platforms
   with more features than ever).

 * Many bugs fixed...


Highlights:

 * General

   OpenGL-0.63 is required for PDL::Graphics::TriD.

   Convert::UU is required for PDL.

   Karma is DEPRECATED and NOT SUPPORTED.  Set
   USE_KARMA=>1 in perldl.conf to force a build.
   
   
 * New 2D Image Display Feature: imag2d()

   See PDL::Graphics2D for documentation.

   Add image pixel value display on mouse
   click in imag2d window
   
   Add keyboard command shortcuts for imag2d
   (with placeholders)

   Fix a number of imag2d() usabiilty bugs
   
   
 * pdl() Constructor Can Take String Input

   Allows use of MATLAB-style [ ; ] syntax

   Allows cut-and-paste of printed pdl values
   as input args for pdl()
   
   
 * rcols/wcols Improvements

   Much faster read times

   Multiple columns can read into a single
   pdl varible

   Symmetric handling of perl and pdl
   column data

   Improved format support for CSV file input
   
   
 * Enhanced PDL Shell (Version 2)

   Based on Devel::REPL which must be installed
   along with either Term::ReadLine::Perl or
   Term::ReadLine::Gnu to use the pdl2 features.

   Supports Term::ReadLine::Perl and Term::ReadLine::Gnu.

   Upward compatable with the original PDL shell, perldl.

   Adds completion and command line editing support
   across all PDL platforms.

   Adds support for current package and lexical variables.

   Toggle default print output via the do_print attribute.

   Default prompt for perldl and pdl2 is now 'pdl> '

   help vars now shows results alphabetically

   pdl2 now runs (falls back to) perldl if Devel::REPL
   is not installed or if Term::ReadLine::(Perl|Gnu) is
   not installed.
   
   
 * Other Features

   Fix wmpeg() to use ffmpeg to generate the
   video (sf.net feature request #3010984).

   Added tiled compressed image handling to rfits

   Faster matrix multiply

   Preliminary support for ENVI file format data
   in PDL/IO/ENVI/readenvi.pdl

   PDL "as built" configuration is now saved to %PDL::Config

   Changes file is automatically updated each release

   Add SKIP_KNOWN_PROBLEMS support for build

   Add checks to prevent warnings from access to $HOME
   when it is not defined.
   
   
 * Portability Fixes

   Multiple build improvements for debian platforms

   Improved portability across perl and compiler versions

   Reduced number of fortran dependencies

   Improved support for win32 platforms
   - PDL::GIS::Proj builds for win32
   - PDL::Transform::Proj4 builds for win32
   - PDL::Graphics::PLplot builds for win32
   - PDL::IO::Dumper builds for win32

 * TBD

Highlights:

 * See PDL-2.4.6_992 release notes above



Release notes for PDL 2.4.6_018 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release! It is a snapshot of the
   current git development tree and everything may not work
   correctly or have complete documentation (as in these
   Release notes).

Highlights:

 * Candidate fix for the mysterious t/dumper.t failures
   for some systems, take 2.  If you still see failures,
   please let us know.  Thanks.



Release notes for PDL 2.4.6_017 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release! It is a snapshot of the
   current git development tree and everything may not work
   correctly or have complete documentation (as in these
   Release notes).

Highlights:

 * Candidate fix for the mysterious t/dumper.t failures
   for some systems.  If you still see failures, please
   let us know.  Thanks.



Release notes for PDL 2.4.6_016 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release! It is a snapshot of the
   current git development tree and everything may not work
   correctly or have complete documentation (as in these
   Release notes).

Highlights:

 * Add smooth shading for spheres3d()

 * Fix Perl OpenGL detection to remove the OpenGL
   PREREQ_PM if an acceptable version of OpenGL is
   not found.

 * PDL now checks for another pre-existing PDL in your
   perl @INC path and asks you if you wish to continue
   since mysterious failures have been observed during
   tests in that case.
 
 * PDL::AutoLoader now can handle win32 path separators
  (semicolons) in addition to the usual colons.

 * PDL::Config is now loaded by default with use PDL.

 * Various documentation updates of TODO, Perldl2/TODO,
   DEPENDENCIES, Release_Notes and more.



Release notes for PDL 2.4.6_015 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release! It is a snapshot of the
   current git development tree and everything may not work
   correctly or have complete documentation (as in these
   Release notes).

 * Perl 5.6.x is no longer supported.
 
   Perl 5.8.x or higher is now required.  NOTE: PDL
   should still build for 5.6.2 and higher if you edit
   the line in the top level Makefile.PL from 5.008_000
   back to 5.006_002.

Highlights:

 * wmpeg in PDL::IO::Pic now uses ffmpeg to generate the
   movie file instead of the outdated mpeg_encode.  This
   is pretty much a straight translation of the original.
   
   NOTE: Example/IO has a program you can run to create
   a quick check movie.  As there is no formal test for
   this function, feedback on whether this works on your
   platform is most welcome.  Thanks!

   NOTE: For cygwin, ffmpeg requires version 1.7.x to build.

 * PDL::Fit::Polynomial has been modified to remove the
   Slatec library dependency requesting in sf.net feature
   request ticket #2891276.

 * Other sf.net bugs fixed:
     3030998    PDL::Config does not match actual build configuration
     2901170    many warnings w TriD and perl -w

 * sf.net bug #117661, PDL::Complex string routine, has
   been fixed.  In addition, the sum and sumover methods
   now support PDL::Complex piddles.

 * Problem with Ctrl-C killing perldl on win32 has been
   resolved.  The 2nd Ctrl-C was resulting in an EOF from
   the perl readline call which caused the shell to exit.
   Now $PERLDL::NO_EOF=1 is the default for win32.

 * Set SKIP_KNOWN_PROBLEMS environment variable to skip
   tests correspond to reported sf.net bugs.  This allows
   the full test suite to pass which makes it easier to
   check if a new bug has been introduced.  For releases,
   there is a SKIP_KNOWN_PROBLEMS option in perldl.conf.
 
 * Some minor doc changes.



Release notes for PDL 2.4.6_014 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release! It is a snapshot of the
   current git development tree and everything may not work
   correctly or have complete documentation (as in these
   Release notes).


Highlights:

 * pdl2 now runs perldl if Devel::REPL is not found so it
   can be used instead of perldl to start the PDL shell.
 
 * Fix the failure in t/opengl.t when the X display could
   not be opened.  The tests are now skipped in that case.

 * Some minor doc changes.



Release notes for PDL 2.4.6_013 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release! It is a snapshot of the
   current git development tree and everything may not work
   correctly or have complete documentation (as in these
   Release notes).


Highlights:

 * 'make dist' now autogenerates the Changes file from the
   output of git log --stat --since="29 Apr 2009" which
   should avoid the missing Changes file error in future
   distributions.  NOTE: This only works for non-win32
   systems since it assumes the standard git command line
   interface is present.

 *  Put fallback code to glutInitDisplay
      
    There have been CPAN test failures where the Perl OpenGL
    module built and installed ok but then the t/opengl.t
    fails for PDL.  A look at the two tests shows the main
    difference is that POGL checks if the GLUT_ALPHA channel will
    work and if not, tries again without GLUT_ALPHA set.

 * Some minor bug fixes



Release notes for PDL 2.4.6_012 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release! It is a snapshot of the
   current git development tree and everything may not work
   correctly or have complete documentation (as in these
   Release notes).


Highlights:

* t/proj_transform.t has been fixed to skip the tests if
  the input earth image is not correct.  t/proj_transform2.t
  performs the same checks with a synthetic data set which
  should be available on all platforms.  This should close
  bug sf.net #3013751.

* Incorrect threading in lu_backsub() and lu_decomp() has
  been fixed.  This closes bug sf.net #3021567.



Release notes for PDL 2.4.6_011 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release! It is a snapshot of the
   current git development tree and everything may not work
   correctly or have complete documentation (as in these
   Release notes).

 * The main purpose for this release is the additional
   diagnostics in the t/proj_transform.t which may lead
   to an understanding of what the problem is there.


Highlights:

 * pdl2 (the new Perldl2 shell now supports all major
   functions of perldl.  If you have installed the latest
   Devel::REPL you should be able to use this shell as
   an enhanced replacement for perldl.  Feedback welcome!

 * Fix sf.net bug #3021578 re missing xtra dummy dims

 * Add error diagnostics to dummy() in PDL::Core when the
   required position argument is not present.  The new
   message now mentions the dummy() method instead of just
   a line number in Core.pm.

 * Update bess[jy][01n] docs in math.pd
   Fix refs for floor/ceil/rint to use integer

 * Use is() instead of ok() in t/proj_transform.t

   That should give more diagnostic output for failing tests
   to help debug the recent test failures for cygwin 1.7 and
   freebsd 8.0.



Release notes for PDL 2.4.6_010 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release! It is a snapshot of the
   current git development tree and everything may not work
   correctly or have complete documentation (as in these
   Release notes).

Highlights:

 * Experimental perldl version 2 shell available.  See the
   README file in PDL/Perldl2 for details.

   By default, the Perldl2 shell (i.e., pdl2) will be built
   and installed if you have already installed Devel::REPL
   version 1.003011 or higher.

   TAB completion for filenames and history expansion
   using '!' syntax works with either Term::ReadLine::Gnu
   or Term::ReadLine::Perl.  If you use the ! operator in
   your perl code, be sure to follow it by a space so that
   it is not interpreted for history substitution.

   pdl2 now loads your ~/.pdlrc (or ~/.perldlrc) startup
   file and also local.pdlrc (or local.perldlrc) file if
   there is one in the current directory.  Please report
   any problems or missing functionality to the PDL
   mailing list.

   help|usage|apropos|sig|badinfo|demo now autoquote their args.

   ? and ?? aliases for help and apropos work

   Shell command escapes for lines beginning with $PERLDL::ESCAPE
   (defaults to "#") work as well.

 * uniq/uniqind/uniqvec now handle BAD values or NaN
   values consistent with Matlab and between themselves.
   This fixes sf.net bug #3011659.

 * Many win32/win64 portability fixes for PLplot as well
   as various other documentation and other fixes.
   


Release notes for PDL 2.4.6_009 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release!  It is a snapshot of the current git
   development tree and everything may not work correctly.  However,
   it is the easiest way to get the latest and greatest from PDL
   developers without going to the git repository at sourceforge.net.

Highlights:

 * Experimental perldl version 2 shell available.
   See the README file in PDL/Perldl2 for details.
   
   The list history 'l' command now works, as does the
   demo command (partially).  You'll need to quote the
   demo name.  If you get a hang at the end of the demo,
   try typing Ctrl-D.  That appears to work on non-win32
   platforms.

   NOTE: History expansion via ! works but it is not
   yet merged into the saved history.  !-Num will work
   if the command was in the current Perldl2 session.

Release notes for PDL 2.4.6_008 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release!  It is a snapshot of the current git
   development tree and everything may not work correctly.  However,
   it is the easiest way to get the latest and greatest from PDL
   developers without going to the git repository at sourceforge.net.

Highlights:

 * Experimental perldl version 2 shell available.
 
   See the README file in PDL/Perldl2 for details.  Full
   completion support is now available for all platforms
   via Term::ReadLine::Perl as well as Term::ReadLine::Gnu.

   The Perldl2 shell (pdl2) now loads and saves command line
   history from the same file as perldl, ~/.perldl_hist.
   
   Please Note: while all commands are saved and loaded between
   the perldl and pdl2, the Perldl2 shell is missing some features
   of perldl so not all commands retrieved from perldl history
   will execute correctly in a subsequent pdl2 session.

 * Added Convert::UU as a required dependency for PDL to improve
   portability (it provides backup uuencode and uudecode for
   platforms without them).

 * Add work around for perl -d problem with lvalue subroutines
   so that tests: imagend.t, lvalue.t, matrixops.t, misc.t, and
   transform.t now run under the debuger (even for broken perls
   versions 5.10.1 through 5.12)

 * Add fixes for printf and carp format string attacks

 * Preliminary version of spheres3d for plotting 3D spheres
   with TriD.  Support for varying radii and colors not yet
   complete.



Release notes for PDL 2.4.6_007 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release!  It is a snapshot of the current git
   development tree and everything may not work correctly.  However,
   it is the easiest way to get the latest and greatest from PDL
   developers without going to the git repository at sourceforge.net.

Highlights:

 * Experimental perldl version 2 shell available.
 
   See the README file in PDL/Perldl2 for details on how to use.
   Full completion support is now available for all platforms
   via Term::ReadLine::Perl as well as Term::ReadLine::Gnu.

   Work continues to port existing perldl features to the new
   Devel::REPL framework.


Release notes for PDL 2.4.6_006 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release!  It is a snapshot of the current git
   development tree and everything may not work correctly.  However,
   it is the easiest way to get the latest and greatest from PDL
   developers without going to the git repository at sourceforge.net.

Highlights:

 * Experimental perldl version 2 shell available.
 
   See the README file in PDL/Padre for details on how to use.
   Full completion support is now available for all platforms
   via Term::ReadLine::Perl as well as Term::ReadLine::Gnu.

   Work continues to port existing perldl features to the new
   Devel::REPL framework.

 * Preliminary support for MATLAB/Octave array constructor
   notation as allowed input to the pdl() constructor,
   a.k.a. PDL::new.  The same implementation also supports
   cutting and pasting from PDL print output for piddles
   as valid input for pdl in scripts.  Just use the pasted
   input as a string.  For example:

    a  =      [ 1 2 3 ; 4 5 6 ] # MATLAB/Octave
    $a = pdl q[ 1 2 3 ; 4 5 6 ] # PDL/perldl

    Printing $a gives:

    [
     [1 2 3]
     [4 5 6]
    ]

    And we can cut and paste like this

    $a = pdl q[
               [1 2 3]
               [4 5 6]
              ];

    Problem reports and feature suggestions welcome at the
    perldl mailing list.

 * Added tiled compressed image handling to rfits in FITS.pm
   including a new compression module in Lib/Compression.

 * Partial fix for a problem with window shrink creep in imag2d()

 * Fix uniqvec bug from SF# 2978576

 * Fix rt.cpan.org #53815 in IO/HDF/SD/SD.pd

 * Fixes SF bug 2949455 ("demo transform broken"): sign error in FITS
   header CROTA2 interpretation by PGPLOT libraries.

 See the Changes file for the full log entries.



Release notes for PDL 2.4.6_004 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release!  It is a snapshot of the current git
   development tree and everything may not work correctly.  However,
   it is the easiest way to get the latest and greatest from PDL
   developers without going to the git repository at sourceforge.net.

Highlights:

 * rcols() now has support for specifying multicolumn piddles for
   input data and performance has been significantly improved for
   common input data options.

   - Patterns for rcols() may now be specified using
     the qr{} syntax instead of quoted strings.

   - The COLIDS option allows one to return line 0 of
     the data file containing field names/identifiers.
     PERLCOLS may be used to return non-piddle ids from
     the row data.


Release notes for PDL 2.4.6_001 --------------------------

General Notes:

 * This is a developers release!  It is a snapshot of the current git
   development tree and everything may not work correctly.  However,
   it is the easiest way to get the latest and greatest from PDL
   developers without going to the git repository at sourceforge.net.

Highlights:

 * Improved support for user defined column separators for rcols and wcols.
   This makes it possible for rcols and wcols to be (almost) inverses of
   each other and allows better slurping of CSV formatted data files.  See
   help PDL::IO::Misc or help rcols or help wcols for documentation.

   NOTE: $PDL::IO::Misc::colsep is superseded by $PDL::IO::Misc::defcolsep
   to set the default column separator and by the COLSEP option for setting
   on a call by call basis.  The old colsep global is still supported but
   the new usage is recommended.

 * imag2d() window clicks now output the pixel values along with the
   display window pixel location and the input image pixel locations.

 * Many little fixed and documentation improvements.  See git log for info
   and also the Changes file.



Release notes for PDL 2.4.6     --------------------------

General Notes:

 * Mainly a bug fix and polishing release


Highlights:

  * Improved 3D graphics and OpenGL functionality

  * imag2d() routine for multi-image (photo) display

  * Many fixes for Debian package release

  * Several little bugs fixed since PDL-2.4.5

  * Fixed some issues with PDL convolution routines

  * Improved documentation and release notes and files

  * Padre and enhanced perldl shell integration begun


Summary of Changes:

  * Improved 3D graphics and OpenGL functionality

    Perl OpenGL 0.62 is the minimum required version
    for PDL::Graphics::TriD to build.

    TriD now builds correctly for Mac OS X systems
    without X11 installed.

    Autoprobe for build of 3D graphics and the use
    of the Perl OpenGL library has been implemented.
    The default perldl.conf setting is to check.

    Improved multi-window support for PDL::Graphics::TriD
    display windows: the GLUT window ID is now part of
    the default window title for convenience, and redraws
    with multiple open TriD windows are handled correctly.
    
  * imag2d() routine for multi-image (photo) display

    REQUIRES: The Perl OpenGL TriD interface and FreeGLUT.

    IMPORTANT: Legacy X11 TriD is *not* supported!

    It is implemented in the imag2d.pdl file for autoloading
    via PDL::AutoLoader.  To use, copy the imag2d.pdl file
    to somewhere in your PDLLIB path or add the location to
    your PDLLIB environment variable.

    It works with multiple, simultaneous, image windows
    and appears to work side-by-side with TriD graphics
    windows.
    
    After you have imag2d.pdl in your @PDLLIB list,
    you can use 'help imag2d' to get usage instructions
    and documentation.
    
    This implements the basic functionality planned regarding
    an improved imagrgb() routine.

  * Many fixes for Debian package release

    This should allow PDL-2.4.6 to be more readily released
    as a Debian packages.  The general clean up involved
    improves PDL portability and robustness generally.

  * Several little bugs fixed since PDL-2.4.5

    The number of history lines when you use Term::ReadLine::Perl
    with perldl are now set correctly to $PERLDL::HISTFILESIZE.
    The default value is 500.

    A number of minor internal fixes for portability and
    implementation improvements:

     - Add comment re fix for defined(%hash) usage
     - Fix annoying PGPLOT::HANDLE warning message
     - Replace GIMME by GIMME_V in Core.xs
     - Update to v3.14 of ppport.h portability

    Fixed MINUIT build problem where non-standard code was
    being generated which caused problems with rigorous compiler
    settings.  This was SF bug #2524068.

  * Fixed a number of issues with PDL convolution routines

    conv1d() algorithm adjusted to match conv2D() and convolutionND().
    Documentation on the exact computation being performed in conv1d()
    was added.

    Fixes bug #2630369 with fftconvolve().  It now gives the same results
    as conv1d(), conv2d(),.., except perhaps with respect to the boundary
    condition handling.

  * Improved documentation and release notes and files

    Updated PDL::FAQ.

    Lots of little changes to bring documentation in line
    with current PDL functionality.  Volunteer editors and
    contributors always welcome!

  * Padre and enhanced perldl shell integration begun

    There is a new PDL-2.4.6/Padre/ subdirectory in the PDL
    source tree which contains work towards Padre integration
    and a 2nd generation, enhanced perldl shell for PDL.

    E.g. an *experimental* plug-in giving PDL::NiceSlice support
    to the Devel::REPL shell is included.  See the Padre/README
    file for instructions to get you started.



Release notes for PDL 2.4.5_008 --------------------------

Highlights:

  * This is a DEVELOPER's release for testing

  * Effectively PDL-2.4.6 release candidate 2

  * OpenGL-0.62 is now the required version for TriD

  * Removed unneeded platform special cases for USE_3D
    in perldl.conf



Release notes for PDL 2.4.5_007 --------------------------

Highlights:

  * This is a DEVELOPER's release

  * Move TriD example/test progs to Example/TriD

  * Add better example to imag2d() documentation
  
  * Add q or Q to Quit message to twiddle routine

  * Minor code fixes.



Release notes for PDL 2.4.5_006 --------------------------

Highlights:

  * This is a DEVELOPER's release

  * imag2d() available for viewing images with square pixels.

    REQUIRES: The Perl OpenGL TriD interface and FreeGLUT,
              legacy X11 TriD is not supported.

    It is implemented in the imag2d.pdl file for autoloading
    via PDL::AutoLoader.  To use, copy the imag2d.pdl file
    to somewhare in your PDLLIB path or add the location to
    your PDLLIB environment variable.

    It works with multiple, simultaneous, image windows
    and appears to work side-by-side with TriD graphics
    windows.



Release notes for PDL 2.4.5_005 --------------------------

Highlights:

  * This is a DEVELOPER's release

  * Fixed conv1d() bug where it was actually calculating the
    correlation and not the convolution.  For symmetric kernels
    they are the same.

  * Fixed fftconvolve to give the same results as the other
    convolution algorithms.  The new implementation is
    probably slower than the previous and definitely uses
    more temporary memory.  The old routine is preserved
    as fftconvolve_inplace() if needed.  This was listed
    as SF bug #2630369.

  * Fixed SF bug #2524068 for PDL::Minuit.  Now use pp_addxs()
    to define the binding to mnseti() to avoid bug in pp_def()
    when there are no piddle arguments.

  * TriD graphics windows now have their GLUT window ID in
    the window title.  This allows for simpler identification
    and use of multiple TriD graphics windows.

  * Fixed the TriD display() routine to set the current GLUT
    window before drawing takes place.   Now multiple TriD
    windows can exist and be drawn to.



Release notes for PDL 2.4.5_004 --------------------------

Highlights:

  * This is a DEVELOPER's release

  * Fix OpenGLQ headers for AGL GLUT only build

  * Make Perl OpenGL 0.61 the minimum version
    OpenGL-0.61 has a needed fix to some FreeGLUT parameters that
    are required for correct event loop exit handling.

  * Fix bug with _have_freeglut check
    The new() method was using $OpenGL::_have_freeglut to test
    rather than the correct OpenGL::_have_freeglut().

  * Multiple fixes supporting Debian package for PDL-2.4.5

  * Fix OpenGLQ/Makefile.PL use/require problem
    Had require but with use statement syntax.

  * Fix some TriD OpenGL config and test bugs
    This should help with CPAN automated testers.

  * Removed automated testing USE_POGL=>1 setting
    This and the hardwired 1 in the perldl.conf may have been
    the origin of a lack of CPAN automated testers reports.

  * Fix perldl.conf to set USE_POGL => undef

  * Update Basic/Core/ppport.h to latest version, 3.14 from 3.09
    This should not break anything.



Release notes for PDL 2.4.5 ------------------------------

Highlights:

  * 3D graphics modules now run on win32 and Mac OS X
    systems without requiring X11 be installed.  The
    only prerequisites are OpenGL and FreeGLUT/GLUT.

  * Release documentation and FAQ have been updated
    to be more useful (and more accurate).

  * PDL build, test, and run time diagnostic messages
    have been make clearer and more helpful.

  * Many bugs have been fixed since PDL-2.4.4 so this
    is the most reliable PDL ever.

  * PDL now requires perl 5.6.2 or greater and has
    updated DEPENDENCIES information and code.  This
    should improve the buildability of PDL


General Notes:

  This is the first PDL release supporting the new build
  strategy for the PDL::Graphics::TriD modules.  The result
  is it now builds on more platforms than ever.  You'll
  need to install the OpenGL module and have FreeGLUT or
  GLUT (for Mac OS X) on your system.

  If you have problems with the new TriD build (that you
  did not have before), edit perldl.conf and set USE_POGL
  to 0.  That should enable you to build the legacy TriD
  code but you *will* want to submit a bug report, see the
  next point....

  IMPORTANT: Given the increased portability and generality
  of the new TriD interface approach, it is expected that
  the legacy TriD build interface (based on X11) will be
  deprecated soon (almost immediately) and removed after that.
  (N.B. It has been effectively unsupported for some time)

  If you are new to PDL, we recommend joining the perldl
  mailing list for discussion and questions.  See

    http://pdl.sourceforge.net/maillists/

  for how to sign up and links and searches of the list
  archive discussions.


Summary of Changes:
  
  New perldl.conf configuration parameters controlling
  build of TriD with perl OpenGL (a.k.a. POGL) with the
  follow default values:

    USE_POGL:
          1 -- build using POGL
          0 -- build using legacy build process
      undef -- build with POGL if possible

    POGL_VERSION:
       0.60 -- minimum required version of OpenGL

    POGL_WINDOW_TYPE:
     'glut' -- use a GLUT GUI for window creation
      'x11' -- use GLX and X11 for the GUI (this is a "compatibility
               mode" to support PDL::Graphics::TriD::Tk widgets)

  NOTE: Set WITH_3D => 0 in perldl.conf to disable the
  TriD build completely.  Just setting USE_POGL => 0 is
  not enough.
  
  The OpenGL tests in t/opengl.t now respects the interactive
  setting from the PDL_INT environment variable.

  Two TriD check programs, 3dtest.pl and line3d.pl, are added to the
  main PDL build directory.  They can be run as quick checks of the
  new functionality and are short enough run under the perl debugger
  if needed. e.g.

     perl -Mblib 3dtest.pl OR perl -Mblib line3d.pl


  OpenGL (a.k.a. GL) is the default TriD output device on all
  platforms.  VRML does not work at the moment.  GLpic is not
  tested but may work.

  Closed SF bug #1476324 by adding FAQ entry on clean installs

  Fix qsorti(null()) crash bug from SF bug #2110074.  Make
  qsorti() return quietly when given a null() piddle input

  Fix broken PP typemap finding code, thanks to CS for the
  final code and many testers!
  
  Fix t/autoload.t tilde expansion bugs and test failures.
  tilde expansion seems to work consistently with bash now

  Partial fix implemented for PDL::IO::Browser.  The code has
  only been tested with cygwin but it should work on systems
  with ncurses in the "right place".  This is **not tested**
  but set WITH_IO_BROWSER => 1 if you wish to try.

  If the perldl shell is unable to load PDL for some reason
  and defaults to basic perl support, the prompt now changes
  to perl> reflecting that fact.

  readflex() now works with File::LinearRaid.

  Many win32 fixes to tests and build process which make
  things work more smoothly on win32 platforms.

  See the Changes file or run 'git log --stat' for the detailed
  list of changes.
  


Release notes for PDL 2.4.4_136 --------------------------

General Notes:

     *************************************
     *                                   *
     *   This is a development release   *
     *                                   *
     *************************************

  If you have OpenGL installed, PDL::Graphics::TriD should
  build out of the box for MSWin32, Mac OS X, and traditional
  unix platforms (linux, *bsd, solaris) using the new GLUT
  framework for the OS window creation and manipulation.

  IMPORTANT: Given the increased portability and generality of
  the new TriD interface approach, it is expected that the legacy
  TriD build interface (based on X11) will be deprecated soon
  (almost immediately) and removed after that.  It has been
  effectively unsupported for some time.


Summary of Changes:

  TriD now requires Perl OpenGL-0.59 or greater to build.

  The new PDL::Graphics::TriD is available on all platforms
  supporting Perl OpenGL (a.k.a. POGL).

     NOTE: There are two example programs at the top PDL/
     directory: 3dtest.pl and line3d.pl which you can use
     to exercise the TriD module: e.g.

       perl -Mblib 3dtest.pl OR perl -Mblib line3d.pl

  New, more portable code for finding the system typemaps files
  is implemented.

  IO::Browser now builds on cygwin and may work for other
  systems.  Set WITH_IO_BROWSER => 1, if you dare!

  The perldl shell now changes it prompt to perl> from the
  perldl> default if PDL was not able to be loaded.

  Clean up of the IO/GD/Makefile.PL for win32 platforms.

  See the Changes file or run 'git log --stat' for detailed
  list of changes.

  An example GLUT program using fonts, bitmap.c, is in the
  PDL top level directory.  If you have problems with font
  errors, try compiling this to see if the issue is a GLUT
  or FreeGLUT installation problem or in the PDL/Perl bindings.
  Contact the perldl mailing list for help.

     *************************************


Summary of Changes:

   To support development testing and unique identification for
   clearer communication, the pushes to git will have their
   version incremented in the last place after the _ along
   with updates to the prerequisite version in the use OpenGL
   statements.  If you cannot build PDL+POGL because of a
   missing OpenGL release version and you have not seen an
   announcement on the perldl mailing list of that developers
   release, you'll need to obtain it from the corresponding
   git repostory on sourceforge.

     There are two demo/test programs at the top PDL/ directory:
     3dtest.pl and line3d.pl which you can use to exercise the
     TriD module.  If those work ok for you, please feel free to
     try a 'perl -Mblib perldl' followed by 'demo 3d'.

   Now has Perl OpenGL-0.58_007 or greater as a CPAN prerequisite
   for testing the new TriD code using the Perl OpenGL module
   (a.k.a. POGL) to provide the bindings to OpenGL, GLU, and GLUT,
   in git only so far.

   The current release includes a patch to fix a reported problem
   locating the Mac OS X typemaps file.  Mac users, please report
   if you have failures due to this change.

   The code is believed to work on win32 systems, cygwin, and
   linux with the FreeGLUT interface and Mac OS X with the Apple
   GLUT implementation.

   By default, USE_POGL is set in the perldl.conf file to enable
   the new implementation.  Setting it to zero will enable the
   legacy implementation.  If you have to do this to get TriD
   working on a platform that already had it working, please let
   the developers know via the perldl mailing list!

   Once the correct operation of the new TriD code base is confirmed,
   the PDL developers snapshot is expected to be released as the
   PDL-2.4.5 official release.

   for TriD development, this release may be less stable than usual.

   Use option USE_POGL in perldl.conf to toggle the legacy TriD
   code versus the new OpenGL (POGL) based code.  Feedback from
   different platforms encouraged!

   NOTE: USE_POGL is enabled by default for testing purposes.

   The original, pre-CVS to git migration changes are listed in
   Changes_CVS and Changes contains the output from git log --stat
   since April 2009.

   Data::Dumper v2.121 and Storable v1.03 are now explicit
   prerequisites to the PDL build.  This should give better
   diagnostics and makes clear that these modules are essential
   to PDL IO functionality.

   Continue minor fixes and cleanup to main PDL file tree.


Summary of Changes:

    Make Data::Dumper v 2.121 the minimum required

    Avoid lvalue sub syntax requirements
    
    Rework storable test to use Test::More
    
    Fix t/autoload.t test when echo ~ gives ~

     *************************************

     This is another developers release of the latest git PDL.
     More code cleanup, added diagnostics, and updating the
     various documentation.

     The old (pre-git) Changes file has been renamed Changes_CVS
     and the new Changes file is generated from the output of the
     git log --stat command.  This should make it easier to keep
     the changes file up to date.  Any developer or interested
     user can download the full repository and run git log to see
     all the history in its glory.


Summary of Changes:

   Move Changes to Changes_CVS to prep for git log

     We plan to move from a manual Changes file to an automatically
     generated one extracted from the git log messages.  The initial
     command is "git log --stat" and will be added to the make dist
     command eventually.  For now, just generate by hand before making
     a CPAN distribution.

   Added PERL5OPT unset for podselect command

     Missed the podselect in Basic/Gen/Makefile.PL.
     This unsets PERL5OPT before running podselect
     in the generated Makefile.  That should prevent
     false failures due to Devel::Autoflush not being
     available...

   Make tilde test check against `echo ~` result

     Since the goal is to give the same result as the
     shell (i.e. bash) expansion of ~, and since all the
     false test failures had the PDL::AutoLoader giving
     the same result as `echo ~`, I've just made that
     the result to check against.

   Win32 - MSVC-specific fix for setvaltobad() for PDL_Float
   
     In Basic/Bad/bad.pd:
     Provide special handling for setvaltobad() wrt PDL_Float piddles.
     Applies only to MSVC++ compilers prior to version 8.0.
     Thanks to creamygoodness, BrowserUk, ig and ELISHEVA:
     http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=781347

   Win32 - Reduce scope of MSVC-specific bugfix

     Some MS compiler bugs have been fixed in later
     versions of the compiler.
     This allows us to change each occurrence of:
     #ifdef _MSC_VER
       to:
     #if defined _MSC_VER && _MSC_VER < 1400

   Basic/Core/Dev.pm - tweak setting of WriteMakefile() LIBS

     Instead of specifying LIBS=>[] (on those occasions when LIBS
     should be empty) pdlpp_stdargs_int() and pdlpp_stdargs() would
     have LIBS=>[''] and LIBS=>[' '] respectively.
     Minor rewrite to pdlpp_stdargs_int() and pdlpp_stdargs() to fix this.

   Added $! to another Basic/Core/Dev.pm die message
   Added $! to Basic/Core/Dev.pm tempfile error

     The die when trylink failed to open its temporary
     output file did not include the system error reported.
     That has been added to the output to improve debugging.

   Added diag print for t/dumper.t small sdump()

     There have been persistent t/dumper.t failures
     on some BSD platforms.  Adding a diag() to print
     the result of the first sdump() string to give
     a clue as to what the problem is.

   Fix readflex() to work with File::LinearRaid

     readflex() in IO/FlexRaw/FlexRaw.pm use method syntax for
     read with an input file handle.  This failed with a tied
     file handle as is used by File::LinearRaid.  Replacing the
     usage $d->read(...) by read($d, ...) fixed the incompatibility.
     I don't know if it should have worked the other way or not.

   Fold in [dn]make correction to PERL5OPT fix

     The "fix" for the -MDevel::Autoflush did not
     work with dmake or nmake (presumably because of
     the non-sh command shell).

     PDL now requires perl 5.6.2 or higher.

     More incremental bug fixes along the way to a
     PDL-2.4.5 release which is planned to have the
     reworked 3D graphics support.


Summary of Changes:

        Updated the top level readme type files to correct
        link information, remove cvs references, and to add
        information on changes and outstanding issues.

        Fixed a bug in the t/autoload.t tests that resulted in
        false fails for the now fixed tilde expansion.

        Add cast to $GENERIC(a) for setvaltonan() to improve support
        for non-double piddles.

        Continue to clean up the default release and development files
        following the migration from cvs to git.

        PDL now explicitly requires perl 5.6.2 or above.
        
          No PASSes have been reported to CPAN Testers
          for PDL with perl 5.6.0 or 5.6.1, ever.  This
          modification sets better expectations for PDL users.

        Update FAQ for CVS->Git migration

        Change $PDL::VERSION to 2.4.4_03git for devel

        Fix t/proj_transform to skip when no earth_image()

          Missing jpegtopnm functionality in NetPBM or other
          causes earth_image() to fail on some platforms.
          This modifies the test to skip the remaining tests
          if earth_image() can not be loaded.

     *   This is a development release   *
     *                                   *
     *************************************


Summary of Changes:

     - Several SF.net bugs have been fixed

     - pctover() and oddpctover() should generate more accurate
       results with greater consistency to MS Excel calculations

     - PDL should pass automated build tests on more platforms



Release notes for PDL 2.4.4 ------------------------------

General Notes:

     - Bad value support is now enabled by default for
       PDL builds.  This feature allows simpler handling
       of missing or invalid data during processing.

       For example, missing pixels could be interpolated
       across.  Calculations could be skipped for
       missing data points...
       
       Edit the perldl.conf file to turn off bad value
       support before compiling if needed.

     - This release includes significant improvments
       in portability, enhancements in functionality,
       and *many* bugs fixed.

     - PDL::Graphics::TriD modules for 3-D and image
       visualization are being refactored for improved
       portability and performance.  Preliminary hooks
       are in PDL-2.4.4 to support the new functionality.
       
       Announcements to the perldl mailing list will be
       made when the PDL::Graphics::OpenGL::Perl and
       Term::ReadLine::FreeGLUT suport is on CPAN.

     - Builds out-of-the-box on cygwin and win32
     
     - perl 5.6.x is explicitly required to configure and
       will go away in future versions.  5.8.x and above
       are the recommended versions


Summary of Changes:

     - Improve uuencode support in Dumper for additional OSes
       such as *BSD varieties that may need additional options
       to prevent stripping of the leading slash in pathnames
       including: darwin, netbsd, openbsd, freebsd, and dragonfly.
      
     - Updated more PDL tests to use the recommended Test::More
      
     - Updated PDL::Graphics::PLplot build support for more 5.9.0
       specific features
      
     - AutoLoader ~ expansion has been updated to conform more
       closely to the ~ expansion in the bash shell
      
     - Better checks for a valid PROJ4 build environment are now
       performed before attempting to compile PDL modules using it
      
     - PDL now builds and runs on perl-5.10.x
      
     - The perldl shell has added support for using FreeGLUT for
       display in analogy with the existing Tk event loop support.
       This enables refactoring of the TriD modules to use the
       Perl OpenGL module (a.k.a. POGL) instead of the internal,
       and deprecated, PDL::Graphics::OpenGL et. al.
      
     - The perldl acquire/filter/execute loop is now $_-safe by
       using $lines instead of $_ for all the central modifications.
       Avoids problems with some AUTOLOAD functions that leaked $_.
      
     - Removed ExtUtils::F77 from the required prerequisites for
       PDL to improve the buildability on platforms without an
       available fortran compiler.  If you have a fortran compiler
       and EU::F77 installed, PDL::Slatec will be built.
      
     - zeros function added as an alias for the zeroes function
         
     - Many warning messages that were not actually problems have
       been quieted, especially many pointer to int conversion messages
      
     - Added $PERLDL::HISTFILESIZE to allow configuration of the number
       of lines of history to be saved by the interactive PDL shell.
      
     - Fixed implementation of the pctover() function to address bug
       #2019651 on sf.net.  Added explicit documentation in the code
       on the algorithm being used.
      
     - Various updates to the PDL FAQ
      
     - Implemented a PDL interface to the Minuit minimization library
       from CERN
      
     - Removed circular dependency in PDL Makefile.PL Makefile generation
       process which caused builds with some versions of make to fail
      
     - Multiple fixes to enhance configuration and build for win32
     
     - Added basic table-inversion to t_lookup for PDL::Transform
      
     - Fixed problem in uniqvec() where it failed to generate a correct
       result if all the input vectors were the same, fixed bug #1869760
      
     - Add improved 16-bit image support for IO with rpic() and wpic()
       provided you have a recent version of the NetPBM library that
       supports 16-bit images
      
     - Enabled building of GSL on Win32.
    


Release notes for PDL 2.4.3 ------------------------------

General Notes:

     - again, mainly a bugfix and polishing release.

     - builds out-of-the-box on cygwin and win32 build environment
       has been significantly improved
     
     - perl 5.6.x is now deprecated; 5.8.x is recommended.  Support
       for 5.6.x may go away in future versions.  


Summary of Changes:

     - PDL now builds under cygwin on windows PC including
       TriD(OpenGL) 3D graphics and PGPLOT and PLplot 2D graphics
       support. See PDL/cygwin/ and files README and INSTALL for
       details and how to build/install external dependencies.
     
     - The win32 build has been improved.  See PDL/win32/INSTALL
       for details.
     
     - Many fixes from the Debian build patches have been
       incorporated.  See PDL/debian for specifics.
     
     - 64bit platform build has been improved.
     
     - New functionality, functions and modules:
         
         * Bad value support has been extended to per-PDL bad
           values as an experimental feature. To use, configure
           WITH_BADVAL => 1 and BADVAL_PER_PDL => 1 in perldl.conf
           before building.

         * PDL::GSL::INTEG now supports the calculation of
           nested integrals

         * New function tcircle (threaded circle) added to 
           PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT This draws multiple circles in
           one go (see also tpoints and tline)

         * Added set operation routines for pdls treated as sets
           (help setops).

         * PDL::IO::GD module interface to the GD runtime image
           libaray (http://www.boutell.com/gd/) has been integrated.

         * The PDL::GIS::Proj and PDL::Transform::Proj4 modules
           to interface to the PROJ4 Cartographic Projections
           Library (http://proj.maptools.org/) have been added.

         * PDL::IO::HDF provides an interface to the HDF4
           library (http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/).
     
     
     - The PDL test suite (i.e. tests in in PDL/t) has been
       enhanced. Coverage has improved and output diagnostic
       messages are more useful. Test::More is becoming the
       preferred test module. The vanilla Test and Test::Simple
       may be deprecated in the future.

     - PDL core code has been fixed to address valgrind-detected
       errors and to enable better bad value support including the
       new experimental per-PDL bad values. These changes will
       require a re-build/install of any external modules using
       the C interface of PDL. See perldl.conf to configure the
       new bad value support.

     - Several TriD graphics build problems have been resolved.
       The TriD rotation bug has been fixed.

     - Many other bug fixes too numerous to mention. See the
       PDL/Changes file for details.

     - Multiple fixes and additions to PDL documentation as well
       as the PDL::FAQ.

General Notes:

     - again, mainly a bugfix and polishing release.
     
     - perl 5.6.x is now deprecated; 5.8.x is recommended.  Support
       for 5.6.x may go away in future versions.  

     - a little too late for Christmas; but happy new year 2005!


Summary of Changes:

 - Overhaul of FITS I/O.  FITS binary tables are now supported,
   for both reading and writing.

 - Many improvements to PLplot handling

 - New Graphics::Limits package determines display range for multiple 
   concurrent data sets

 - Better PDL::reduce function

 - Improvements to PDL::Transform

 - pdl() constructor is more permissive -- you can feed it PDLs and 
  it does the Right Thing most of the time.

 - Cleaner handling of config files

 - Improvements to multi-line parsing in the perldl shell

 - New 'pdl' command-line entry to perldl shell allows #!-style
   scripting (so you can re-use your journal files verbatim)

 - Several fixes for Microsoft Windows operation

 - PDL::undefval works properly, also has warning tripwires

 - statsover finally seems to produce meaningful, consistent RMS values

 - Several 64-bit compatibility issues (this work is probably not yet
  complete).

Release notes for PDL 2.4.0 -------------------------------

General Notes:

     - Perl 5.6.0 or later is now required, along with the modules
       Filter and Text::Balanced.

     - After installing PDL 2.4.0 external PDL modules will need to re-built.
       (any such modules will refuse to load until they have been re-built)
       
     - New demos of the PDL::Transform and PDL::Transform::Cartography
        modules have been added to perldl.
       Type 'demo transform' or 'demo cartography' in the perldl shell. 
        ( Note that PGPLOT is required to run )

Summary of Changes:

     - The NiceSlice syntax comes of age
       (Nice slicing has been around a while, but really needs to be 
        acknowledged as the main way of slicing PDLs...)

     - New GSL functionality: greatly improved access to the Gnu Scientific
       Library, including interpolation, finite-difference, random
       variable, and other routines.

     - New, very powerful indexing and slicing operators allow boundary 
          conditions   (range, indexND)

     - N-dimensional indexing (indexND) and selection (whichND) methods

     - Powerful syntax for coordinate transformation and arbitrary image
       resampling and coordinate transformations -- including high powered
       spatially-variable filtering (PDL::Transform module)

     - Support for major cartographic transformations
       (PDL::Transform::Cartography module)

     - New PLPlot graphics interface ( cleaner and faster than PGPLOT )

     - Many improvements to the PGPlot interface:
       * Strong FITS support (easy display of images, vectors, & contours in
            science coordinates)
       * Better vector graphic support [including improvements to line() and
         a new routine, lines()]
       * Much cleanup of errors and bugs
       * Spinlocks prevent interrupt-related PGPLOT crashes (requires Perl 5.8)
       * RGB output to truecolor devices (requires PGPLOT-5.3devel)

     - Improvements to the perldl shell:
       * Many bug fixes
       * Multi-line inputs to the perldl shell for easier cut-n-paste
       * ^D blocking on demand (controlled by perl variable or command-line 
          switch)
       * Autoloading detects error conditions on compile
       * New demos

    - Header copying is now explicit rather than by reference -- so that,
      e.g., FITS file manipulation is more intuitive and natural.

    - Improved support for Astro::FITS::Header

    - Bad value support is improved

    - Several new utility routines, including glue(), zcheck(), and ndcoords().

    - Better matrix operation support: matrix operations are now in 
        PDL::MatrixOps, and are all threadable.  Singular value decomposition,
        determinant, linear equation solving, matrix inversion, 
        eigenvalue decomposition, and LU-decomposition.

Release notes for PDL 2.3.4 -------------------------------

     - Now should compile using perl 5.8.0
     - Improved speed for generating PDL's from a perl array ref
     - Added PDL::IO::Storable, which enables PDL storage/retrieval
       using the Storable package.
     - Added  PDL::GSL::SF (Gnu Scientific Library, Special Functions) hierarchy
     - New % operator follows (mathematically correct) perl % operator behavior
     - Numerous Bug Fixes
        
  See the Changes file for a detailed list of changes.

Release notes for PDL 2.3.3 -------------------------------
  
  Mainly a bugfix release with some nice little additions:
     - PDL::IO::Dumper: Cleanly save and restore complex
        data structures including PDLs.  
     - Support for the new Astro::FITS::Header module
       (availiable on CPAN).
        
  See the Changes file for a detailed list of changes.

Release notes for PDL 2.3.2 ------------------------------

A pure bugfix release to fix compilation problems with gimp-perl
(part of the gimp distribution). The following notes from
2.3 and 2.3.1 still apply:

Release notes for PDL 2.3.1 ------------------------------

A bugfix release to fix some compilation problems seen with
2.3. The following notes from 2.3 still apply:

Release notes for PDL 2.3 -------------------------------
 
 Summary of Changes
   - A nicer slicing syntax for PDL added via the new 
     PDL::NiceSlice module.
   - Inline::Pdlpp module added, which enables in-line
     PDL::PP definitions. (i.e. no Makefiles, building
      hassles for creating PP code)
   - A Multitude of bug fixes, doc updates, and other
     changes.
     
  Note:Support for perl version 5.005 and previous is 
  limited in this release. Perl 5.6.0 or greater is
  recommended for full PDL functionality.
        
  See the Changes file for a detailed list of changes.
  
Release notes for PDL 2.2.1 -------------------------------
 
 Summary of Changes
    Bugs Fixed:
          - 'pow' function fixed in math.pd
          - Misc memory leaks fixed.
          - PGPLOT 'undefined window size' 
             bug fixed.
          - Test failures with opengl.t fixed.
          - Error in output of 'minimum_n_ind' function
            fixed.
            
    Misc Changes:
        - Documentation updates.
        - Updates to work with perl5.6.1
        
  See the Changes file for a detailed list of changes.
  
Release notes for PDL 2.2 -------------------------------

Major Changes:

  - 'Bad' Value Support added. With this option compiled-in, certain
     values in a PDL can be designated as 'Bad' (i.e. missing, empty, 
     etc). With this designation, most PDL functions will properly 
     ignore the 'Bad' values. See PDL::BadValues for details.
     
  - PGPLOT interface rewritten. New Features:
      - Interactive cursors (cursor)
      - Text on plots       (text)
      - Legends             (legend)
      - Circles, Rectangles, Ellipses
      - Multiple plot windows, one can jump from panel to panel when
        the window is divided in several.
      - More control over options - see PDL::Graphics::PGPLOTOptions for
        details.
      - New Examples in Example/PGPLOT.

   - Major updates to the Tri-D Code. Now requires perl 5.6 for TriD.
    
   - 'Reduce' function added. This provides a consistent interface to the
     projection routines (sumover, average, etc). See PDL::Reduce.
     
   - Improved OpenGL detection during 'perl Makefile.PL

   - pdldoc command added. This allows you to look up PDL 
     documentation similar to the perldoc command. 
     
   - Perl 5.6 is now recommended for PDL 2.2. It will still work 
     with perl 5.005, but some of the extra libs won't be compiled
     ( like Graphics/TriD).
  
Many other changes. See the Changes file for a detailed list of changes.

Release notes for PDL 2.1 -------------------------------

Major Changes:
  - Speed Increase. Most PDL functions are now done totally
    in C-code, without any perl wrapper functions as was done
    with previous versions. The speedup will be most noticeable
    for operations on many small PDL arrays.
  - Mem Leaks Fixed.
  - Added a consistent, Object-Oriented interface to the 
    various interpolate functions in PDL. (PDL::Func, 
    See Lib/Func.pm).
    
See the Changes file for a detailed list of changes.



Release notes for PDL 2.005 -----------------------------

A bugfix release to fix 2.004 problems with PGPLOT changes
and perl 5.6.0.

The following notes from 2.004 still apply:
                                             
*IMPORTANT NOTE*: Due to changes to the PGPLOT module, 'use
PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT' has been removed from PDL.pm (i.e. in scripts
and within perldl you now need to explicitly say 'use
PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT'). Additionally, it needs Karl's new 2.16
release of the PGPLOT module (available from CPAN).

Notable additions are a module for operations on complex piddles
(PDL::Complex), a subtype of PDL which allows manipulation of byte
type PDLs as N dimensional arrays of fixed length strings (PDL::Char)
and a Levenberg-Marquardt fitting module (PDL::Fit::LM).

Bug reports and patches to the relevant places on sourceforge, please.
